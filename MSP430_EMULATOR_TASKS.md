**Last Updated**: Based on SLAU445_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md and TEST_REVIEW_ISSUES.md analysis

## Current Implementation Status

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT FOUNDATION with Critical Gaps**

### ‚úÖ Completed Components (Phases 1-5)

- **Infrastructure & Setup**: Build system, CI/CD, logging, configuration, automation (100% complete)
- **Core Architecture**: Memory mapping, CPU registers, instruction decoder, emulator core (100% complete)  
- **Memory System**: RAM, Flash/FRAM, Information memory, memory controller (100% complete)
- **Instruction Set**: Format I instructions (arithmetic, logic, data movement) (100% complete)
- **Testing Infrastructure**: 3181 comprehensive tests with 87.8%+ coverage (100% complete)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Attention

1. ~~**Instruction Cycle Counts**: Using additive calculation instead of SLAU445 Table 4-10 lookup~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
2. **Format III Jump Execution**: Decoding complete but execution logic missing (**HIGH PRIORITY**)
3. **Interrupt System**: Completely missing - no interrupt controller or processing (**CRITICAL MISSING**)
4. **Reset Vector Loading**: System reset doesn't load PC from 0xFFFE (**HIGH PRIORITY**)

### üìã Remaining Implementation Work

- Control flow instructions (Format III execution fixes needed)
- Interrupt system (critical missing component)
- Peripheral systems (timers, I/O ports, etc.)
- MSP430X extended instructions (20-bit addressing)
- Advanced features and documentation

### üéØ SLAU445I Compliance Status

- **Excellent**: CPU registers, status register, addressing modes, Format I instructions, instruction cycle counts
- **Good with Issues**: Format III jumps
- **Missing**: Interrupt handling, reset vector loading, MSP430X instructions

## Task List Maintenance Guidelines

**For general AI developer guidance, see [AI Developer Guidelines](.github/copilot-instructions.md).**

This section provides specific guidance for maintaining and evolving this task list document.

### Continuous Task List Assessment

AI developers working on this project should regularly reassess and update this task list based on:

**New Information Sources**:

- MSP430 family datasheets and errata documents
- Real hardware testing results and behavioral discoveries
- Community feedback and bug reports
- Performance profiling and optimization insights
- Security vulnerability assessments

**Task List Update Triggers**:

- When discovering MSP430 behavioral edge cases not covered in current tasks
- When identifying more efficient implementation approaches
- When encountering technical blockers requiring task restructuring
- When new testing strategies reveal gaps in acceptance criteria
- When defects indicate missing validation steps

**Update Process**:

1. **Document Discovery**: Log new information source and key findings
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate which existing tasks need modification
3. **Task Revision**: Update acceptance criteria, dependencies, or effort estimates
4. **New Task Creation**: Add tasks for newly identified requirements
5. **Priority Rebalancing**: Adjust task ordering based on risk and dependencies
6. **Validation**: Ensure updated tasks maintain consistency and completeness

### Adaptive Development Approach

- **Fail Fast**: If a task approach proves ineffective, document lessons learned and revise
- **Iterative Refinement**: Use insights from completed tasks to improve remaining tasks
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Regularly verify task implementation against MSP430 specifications
- **Community Integration**: Incorporate feedback from hardware experts and emulation community

## Task Ordering Philosophy

1. **Infrastructure & Setup** - Essential project foundation including defect management and automation
2. **Core Architecture** - Basic emulator framework with visual documentation
3. **CPU Core** - Fundamental processing unit with state diagrams
4. **Memory System** - Data storage and access with layout diagrams
5. **Instruction Set** - CPU operations (ordered by complexity) with flow diagrams
6. **Peripherals** - External interfaces and devices with interaction diagrams
7. **Advanced Features** - Debugging, optimization, validation with workflow diagrams
8. **Documentation & Polish** - User-facing materials with comprehensive visual guides
