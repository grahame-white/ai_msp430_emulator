## Critical Test Coverage Gaps Identified

### 1. Limited FRAM-Specific Behavior Tests ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

- **Issue**: Tests validate FRAM memory regions but not FRAM-specific behaviors
- **Current State**: Memory region tests exist but lack FRAM controller specifics
- **Missing Coverage**:
  - FRAM wait state control
  - FRAM ECC (Error Correction Code) behavior
  - FRAM power control modes
  - FRAM vs Flash behavioral differences
- **Required Documentation**: SLAU445I Section 6 (FRAM Controller)
- **Impact**: FRAM controller emulation accuracy

### 2. Missing Power Management Tests ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

- **Issue**: No power management or Low Power Mode (LPM) tests
- **Current State**: No power management test files found
- **Missing Coverage**:
  - LPM0-LPM4.5 mode transitions
  - Wake-up event handling
  - Power consumption validation
  - Clock behavior in low power modes
- **Required Documentation**: SLAU445I Section 5 (PMM - Power Management Module)
- **Impact**: Power management emulation completeness

### 3. Limited Instruction Set Test Coverage ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY

- **Issue**: Only partial instruction set testing (arithmetic, logic, data movement)
- **Current State**: Basic instruction categories tested
- **Missing Coverage**:
  - Complete MSP430X instruction set
  - Addressing mode edge cases
  - Instruction timing validation
  - CPU flag behavior edge cases
- **Required Documentation**: SLAU131Y Section 4 (MSP430 Instruction Set)
- **Impact**: Instruction emulation completeness

## Architectural Issues (Require Larger Changes)

### 1. FRAM vs Flash Naming Inconsistency

- **Issue**: FRAM memory region uses enum name `MemoryRegion.Flash` despite MSP430FR2355 having FRAM, not Flash memory
- **Problem**: Confusing terminology - MSP430FR2355 has FRAM, not Flash memory
- **Location**: `src/MSP430.Emulator/Memory/MemoryRegion.cs` line 70 - enum value named `Flash` but comments describe FRAM behavior
- **Impact**: Code works correctly but naming is misleading and causes developer confusion
- **Resolution**: Would require breaking change to enum - rename `Flash` to `Fram`
- **Recommendation**: Document clearly in code comments, consider for major version update

## Test Quality Issues

### 5. Test Documentation

- **Issue**: Some tests lack references to specific MSP430 documentation sections
- **Status**: Partially addressed in integration tests
- **Recommendation**: Add documentation comments explaining which MSP430 specs are validated

## Priority Technical Documentation Gaps

The following technical documentation sections are missing and should be prioritized for implementation accuracy:

### 1. FRAM Controller Behavior (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **Document ID**: SLAU445I (MSP430FR2xx FR4xx Family User's Guide)
- **Sections of Interest**:
  - 6.2 FRAM Organization (memory layout details)
  - 6.5 Wait State Control (performance characteristics)
  - 6.6 FRAM ECC (error correction behavior)
  - 6.8 FRAM Power Control (power management)
- **Impact**: Essential for accurate FRAM vs Flash behavioral differences in emulation
- **Current Gap**: Tests validate memory regions but not FRAM-specific behaviors (wait states, ECC, power control)
- **Recommended Action**: Document and test FRAM-specific behaviors that differ from traditional Flash

### 2. Power Management Module Specifications (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- **Document ID**: SLAU445I (MSP430FR2xx FR4xx Family User's Guide)
- **Sections of Interest**:
  - 5.2 PMM Operation (power management module operation)
  - 5.3 Low-Power Modes (LPM0-LPM4.5 specifications)
  - 5.4 Wake-up Events (wake-up event handling)
- **Impact**: Power management emulation completeness - no power management tests found
- **Current Gap**: No power management or LPM test files exist
- **Recommended Action**: Implement power mode transition and wake-up event tests

### 3. Complete Instruction Set Specifications (LOW PRIORITY)

- **Document ID**: SLAU131Y (MSP430 Assembly Language Tools User's Guide)
- **Sections of Interest**:
  - 4.3 MSP430 Instruction Set (complete instruction specifications)
  - 4.4 MSP430X Instruction Set (extended instruction set)
  - 4.5 Addressing Modes (detailed addressing mode behavior)
- **Impact**: Instruction emulation completeness - only partial instruction set tested
