- **Resolution**: **COMPLETED** - All MSP430-specific test files now have proper TI specification references
- **Current State**: 42 out of 46 test files (91%) have proper TI specification references
- **Progress Completed**:

  - ✅ All core emulator component tests have MSP430 references (4 files)
  - ✅ All CPU component tests have MSP430 references (3 files)
  - ✅ All memory component tests have MSP430 references (8 files)
  - ✅ All configuration tests have MSP430 references (2 files)

- **Impact**: **EXCELLENT** traceability to MSP430FR2355 specifications for all relevant tests
- **Status**: **ISSUE RESOLVED** - All MSP430-specific functionality has proper documentation references

### 2. Limited Instruction Set Test Coverage ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

- **Issue**: Jump/branch instructions and MSP430X extended instruction set have generic test coverage only
- **Current State**:
  - Format I (two-operand) instructions: Comprehensive individual test coverage ✅
  - Format II (single-operand) instructions: Comprehensive individual test coverage ✅
  - Format III (jump/branch) instructions: Generic `FormatIIIInstruction` testing only ⚠️
  - Status bit instructions: Comprehensive test coverage ✅
- **Missing Coverage**:
  - Individual jump/branch instruction tests (JMP, JEQ, JNE, JC, JNC, JN, JGE, JL)
  - Complete MSP430X extended instruction set (20-bit addressing)
  - Addressing mode edge cases for extended instructions
  - Instruction timing validation for cycle-accurate emulation
- **Required Documentation**: SLAU131Y Section 4 (MSP430 Instruction Set), SLAU445I Section 4.5.2
  (MSP430X)
- **Impact**: Complete instruction emulation accuracy for all MSP430FR2355 capabilities

## Architectural Issues (Require Larger Changes)

### 1. FRAM vs Flash Naming Inconsistency

- **Issue**: FRAM memory region uses enum name `MemoryRegion.Flash` despite MSP430FR2355 having FRAM,
  not Flash memory
- **Problem**: Confusing terminology - MSP430FR2355 has FRAM, not Flash memory
- **Location**: `src/MSP430.Emulator/Memory/MemoryRegion.cs` line 70 - enum value named `Flash`
  but comments describe FRAM behavior
- **Impact**: Code works correctly but naming is misleading and causes developer confusion
- **Resolution**: Would require breaking change to enum - rename `Flash` to `Fram`
- **Recommendation**: Document clearly in code comments, consider for major version update

## Test Quality Issues
