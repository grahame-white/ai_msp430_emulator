# Defect Classification System

## Overview
This document defines the defect classification system used in the MSP430 Emulator project to ensure consistent prioritization and handling of issues.

## Severity Levels

### Critical
**Definition:** Severe issues that completely block core functionality or cause system failures.

**Characteristics:**
- System crashes or hangs
- Data corruption or loss
- Security vulnerabilities
- Complete feature failure with no workaround
- Emulation produces incorrect results that could affect real hardware

**Examples:**
- Emulator crashes when loading firmware
- Incorrect instruction execution causing wrong results
- Memory corruption during emulation
- Security vulnerability allowing code execution

**Response Time:** Immediate (within 4 hours)
**Resolution Target:** 24-48 hours

### High
**Definition:** Significant issues that affect major functionality but system remains operational.

**Characteristics:**
- Major feature significantly impaired
- Significant performance degradation
- Important functionality unavailable
- Workaround exists but is complex or unreliable

**Examples:**
- Peripheral emulation not working correctly
- Debugger functionality broken
- Significant performance regression
- Major configuration errors

**Response Time:** Same business day (within 8 hours)
**Resolution Target:** 3-5 business days

### Medium
**Definition:** Issues that affect functionality but have acceptable workarounds.

**Characteristics:**
- Minor feature issues
- Non-critical performance issues
- Usability problems
- Simple workaround available

**Examples:**
- Minor UI issues
- Non-critical logging problems
- Configuration validation issues
- Minor documentation errors affecting functionality

**Response Time:** Next business day
**Resolution Target:** 1-2 weeks

### Low
**Definition:** Minor issues that don't significantly impact functionality.

**Characteristics:**
- Cosmetic issues
- Minor usability improvements
- Documentation typos
- Non-functional enhancements

**Examples:**
- Spelling errors in documentation
- Minor UI alignment issues
- Code style inconsistencies
- Suggested feature enhancements

**Response Time:** Within 1 week
**Resolution Target:** Next planned release cycle

## Classification Guidelines

### Determining Severity
1. **Impact Assessment:** How many users/components are affected?
2. **Functionality Impact:** Is core functionality compromised?
3. **Workaround Availability:** Can users continue working?
4. **Data Integrity:** Is data at risk?
5. **Security Implications:** Are there security concerns?

### Escalation Criteria
- **Auto-escalate to Critical:** Any security vulnerability
- **Auto-escalate to High:** Core emulation accuracy issues
- **Consider escalation:** Customer-reported issues affecting production use

### Special Categories

#### Security Issues
- All security issues start at **High** minimum
- Exploitable vulnerabilities are **Critical**
- Follow responsible disclosure process

#### Performance Regressions
- >50% performance degradation: **High**
- 20-50% performance degradation: **Medium**
- <20% performance degradation: **Low**

#### Accuracy Issues
- Incorrect instruction behavior: **Critical**
- Timing inaccuracies affecting functionality: **High**
- Minor timing discrepancies: **Medium**

## Review Process

### Initial Classification
1. Reporter provides initial severity assessment
2. Triage team reviews within defined response time
3. Severity may be adjusted based on investigation

### Reclassification
- Severity can be changed as more information becomes available
- Escalation requires approval from team lead
- De-escalation requires thorough justification

### Documentation Requirements
- All **Critical** and **High** severity issues must include detailed reproduction steps
- Root cause analysis required for all **Critical** issues
- Post-mortem required for **Critical** issues affecting production

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics
- Time to initial response by severity
- Time to resolution by severity
- Number of defects by severity over time
- Severity accuracy (how often classification changes)

### Reporting Frequency
- **Critical/High:** Daily status updates
- **Medium:** Weekly status updates
- **Low:** Milestone/sprint updates

## Integration with DefectTracker

The DefectTracker class implements this classification system:

```csharp
public enum DefectSeverity
{
    Low = 0,      // Cosmetic, documentation
    Medium = 1,   // Minor functionality issues
    High = 2,     // Major functionality issues
    Critical = 3  // System failures, security issues
}
```

## Tools and Automation

### Automated Classification
- GitHub labels automatically applied based on severity
- Notifications sent to appropriate teams
- SLA tracking based on severity level

### Quality Gates
- **Critical** defects block releases
- **High** defects require explicit release approval
- **Medium/Low** defects tracked but don't block releases
