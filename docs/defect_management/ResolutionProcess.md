## Resolution Strategies

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 5 Whys Technique
1. **Why did the issue occur?** - Immediate cause
2. **Why did that happen?** - Contributing factor
3. **Why was that the case?** - System cause
4. **Why wasn't this prevented?** - Process cause
5. **Why isn't this caught earlier?** - Root cause

#### Fishbone Diagram Categories
- **People:** Human factors, training, experience
- **Process:** Procedures, workflows, standards
- **Technology:** Tools, systems, infrastructure
- **Environment:** External factors, dependencies

### Fix Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Changes
- **Minimal Impact:** Make smallest possible change to fix issue
- **Defensive Programming:** Add appropriate error handling
- **Consistent Style:** Follow project coding standards
- **Performance Aware:** Consider performance implications

#### Testing Requirements
- **Fix Verification:** Test specifically addresses the reported issue
- **Regression Prevention:** Tests prevent issue recurrence
- **Edge Cases:** Cover boundary conditions and error paths
- **Integration:** Ensure fix works with other components

#### Documentation Updates
- **API Changes:** Update API documentation
- **Configuration:** Update configuration guides
- **Troubleshooting:** Add to troubleshooting guides
- **Release Notes:** Document fix for users

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates

#### Critical Issues
- **Frequency:** Every 4 hours during business hours
- **Content:** Current status, blockers, next steps
- **Audience:** Stakeholders, management, affected teams

#### High Issues
- **Frequency:** Daily
- **Content:** Progress summary, estimated completion
- **Audience:** Project team, stakeholders

#### Medium/Low Issues
- **Frequency:** Weekly or at milestone boundaries
- **Content:** Progress summary, changes to timeline
- **Audience:** Project team

### Customer Communication
- **Initial Response:** Within SLA timeframe
- **Progress Updates:** Based on severity level
- **Resolution Notification:** When fix is ready for testing
- **Final Closure:** When issue is completely resolved

### Internal Communication
- **Team Updates:** In daily standups
- **Stakeholder Updates:** Via project management tools

## Regression Prevention

### Test Automation
```csharp
[Fact]
public void DefectRegression_IssueXXX_ShouldNotRecur()
{
    // Arrange - Set up scenario that caused original defect
    var emulator = new MSP430Emulator();
    var testProgram = LoadTestProgram("regression_test_xxx.hex");
    
    // Act - Execute the problematic scenario
    emulator.LoadProgram(testProgram);
    var result = emulator.Execute();
    
    // Assert - Verify fix is working
    Assert.Equal(expectedResult, result);
    Assert.False(emulator.HasErrors);
}
```

### Regression Test Categories

## Integration with DefectTracker

### Status Transitions
```csharp
// Example of moving defect through lifecycle
var defect = defectTracker.GetDefect(defectId);

// Start work on defect
defect.Status = DefectStatus.InProgress;
defect.Assignee = assignedDeveloper;
defectTracker.UpdateDefect(defectId, defect);

// Move to testing
defect.Status = DefectStatus.Testing;
defectTracker.UpdateDefect(defectId, defect);

// Close defect
defect.Status = DefectStatus.Closed;
defectTracker.UpdateDefect(defectId, defect);
```

### Metrics Collection
```csharp
// Generate resolution metrics
var metrics = defectTracker.GetDefectMetrics();
var resolutionTime = CalculateAverageResolutionTime(metrics);
var regressionRate = CalculateRegressionRate(metrics);
```
