# Timer A Figure 13-1 Analysis and Inconsistency Report

This document identifies remaining inconsistencies and outstanding work in the Timer A Figure 13-1 notation that require 
attention.

## Analysis Overview

This analysis focuses on unresolved issues and improvements needed for the Timer A documentation. Completed items have 
been removed to maintain focus on actionable work.

## Outstanding Signal Definition Issues

### Signals with Limited TI Documentation ‚ö†Ô∏è

- `EQU0` - Compare match from CCR0 (limited definition in TI user guide)
- `EQU6` - Compare match from CCR6 (limited definition in TI user guide)

### Signals for Future Documentation üìã

- `POR` - Power-on reset signal (will be defined when power management documentation is added)

## Structural Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Missing Block Interface Definitions ‚ö†Ô∏è

Several blocks still lack complete interface definitions:

```text
Logic: block          # No inputs/outputs specified
  # Should define capture overflow logic

Sync: synchronizer    # Purpose unclear
  # Should clarify edge synchronization function
```

### 2. Signal Type Consistency ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Remaining Issues**:

- Mixed signal width specifications (1-bit, 16-bit, clock, @edge, @bus)
- Some blocks still lack complete type information
- Bidirectional signal notation could be clearer

**Example Improvements Needed**:

```text
# Current:
Timer Clock: (undefined type)
Count: 16-bit @bus
CLK: 1-bit @edge

# Recommended:
TimerClock: clock
CountBus: data @width(16) @bus
ClockInput: clock @edge
```

### 3. Array Notation ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Current Issue**:

```text
CCRn[0..6]: CCR @CCRn[].n = index
```

**Problems**:

- The `@CCRn[].n = index` syntax remains unclear
- Array instantiation rules need clarification
- Connection pattern to timer count not explicit enough

**Recommended Improvement**:

```text
CCRBlocks[0..6]: CCR @array
  # Each CCR block indexed by n (0 to 6, device dependent)
  # All blocks receive timer count via shared bus
  # CCR0.EQU0 provides timer mode control feedback
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Critical Fixes üìã

1. Complete missing block interface definitions
2. Resolve undefined signal references

### Phase 2 - Consistency Improvements üìã

1. Standardize signal type notation
2. Clarify array instantiation syntax
3. Complete bidirectional signal documentation

### Phase 3 - Enhancement ‚ú®

1. Add hierarchical block organization
2. Implement signal attribute validation
3. Create comprehensive connection validation

## Outstanding Work

1. **Complete block interface definitions** (Logic, Sync blocks)
2. **Standardize signal type notation** across all definitions
3. **Clarify array instantiation syntax** for CCR blocks
4. **Validate all signal references** for consistency
