# Timer A Figure 13-1 Analysis and Inconsistency Report

This document identifies remaining inconsistencies and outstanding work in the Timer A Figure 13-1
notation that require attention.

## Analysis Overview

This analysis focuses on unresolved issues and improvements needed for the Timer A documentation.
Completed items have been removed to maintain focus on actionable work.

## Outstanding Signal Definition Issues

### Signals with Limited TI Documentation ⚠️

- `EQU0` - Compare match from CCR0 (limited definition in TI user guide)
- `EQU6` - Compare match from CCR6 (limited definition in TI user guide)

### Signals for Future Documentation 📋

- `POR` - Power-on reset signal (will be defined when power management documentation is added)

## Structural Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Signal Type Consistency ⚠️

**Remaining Issues**:

- Mixed signal width specifications (1-bit, 16-bit, clock, @edge, @bus)
- Some blocks still lack complete type information
- Bidirectional signal notation could be clearer

**Example Improvements Needed**:

```text
# Current:
Timer Clock: (undefined type)
Count: 16-bit @bus
CLK: 1-bit @edge

# Recommended:
TimerClock: clock
CountBus: data @width(16) @bus
ClockInput: clock @edge
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Critical Fixes 📋

1. Standardize signal type notation
2. Resolve undefined signal references

### Phase 2 - Enhancement ✨

1. Implement signal attribute validation
2. Create comprehensive connection validation

## Outstanding Work

1. **Standardize signal type notation** across all definitions
2. **Validate all signal references** for consistency

## Recent Improvements ✅

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Implemented hierarchical block organization with logical groupings:
  - Timer Block organized into ClockPath and TimerCore sub-blocks
  - CCR block organized into InputSelection, CaptureLogic, StorageAndCompare, and OutputLogic sub-blocks
  - Connection references updated to use hierarchical notation
- **Logic and Sync blocks**: Updated with complete interface definitions based on original TI diagram analysis
- **Array notation**: Clarified `@CCRn[].n = index` syntax - each array element has its `n` property set to the array index
- **Connection patterns**: Documented bus distribution syntax for array connections like `Timer Block.Count ->| CCRn[].Count`
  using fanout notation
