# 1.10.2 `SYSJMBO0` and `SYSJMBO1` Outgoing Mailbox

Two 16-bit registers are available for outgoing messages to the JTAG/SBW port. `SYSJMBO0` is only used when using
16-bit transfer mode (`JMBMODE` = 0). `SYSJMBO1` is used in addition to `SYSJMBO0` when using 32-bit transfer mode
(`JMBMODE` = 1). When the application wishes to send a message to the JTAG port, it writes data to `SYSJMBO0` for
16-bit mode, or `JBOUT0` and `JBOUT1` for 32-bit mode.

`JMBOUT0FG` and `JMBOUT1FG` are read only flags that indicate the status of `SYSJMBO0` and `SYSJMBO1`, respectively.
When `JMBOUT0FG` is set, `SYSJMBO0` has been read by the JTAG port and is ready to receive new data. When `JMBOUT0FG`
is reset, the `SYSJMBO0` is not ready to receive new data. `JMBOUT1FG` behaves similarly.
