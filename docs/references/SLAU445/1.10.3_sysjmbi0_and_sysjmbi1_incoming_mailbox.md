# 1.10.3 `SYSJMBI0` and `SYSJMBI1` Incoming Mailbox

Two 16-bit registers are available for incoming messages from the JTAG port. Only `SYSJMBI0` is used in 16-bit
transfer mode (`JMBMODE` = 0). `SYSJMBI1` is used in addition to `SYSJMBI0` in 32-bit transfer mode (`JMBMODE` = 1). To
send a message to the application, the JTAG port writes data to `SYSJMBI0` (for 16 bit mode) or to `SYSJMBI0` and
`SYSJMBI1` (for 32-bit mode).

`JMBIN0FG` and `JMBIN1FG` are flags that indicate the status of `SYSJMBI0` and `SYSJMBI1`, respectively. When
`JMBIN0FG` = 1, `SYSJMBI0` has data that is available for reading. When `JMBIN0FG` = 0, no new data is available in
`SYSJMBI0`. `JMBIN1FG` behaves similarly.

To configure `JMBIN0FG` and `JMBIN1FG` to clear automatically, set `JMBCLR0OFF` = 0 and `JMBCLR1OFF` = 0, respectively.
Otherwise, these flags must be cleared by software.
