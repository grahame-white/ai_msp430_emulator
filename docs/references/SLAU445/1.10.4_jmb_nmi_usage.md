# 1.10.4 JMB NMI Usage

To avoid unnecessary polling, the JMB handshake mechanism can be configured to use interrupts. In 16 bit mode,
`JMBOUTIFG` is set when `SYSJMBO0` has been read by the JTAG port and is ready to receive data. In 32-bit mode,
`JMBOUTIFG` is set when both `SYSJMBO0` and `SYSJMBO1` have been read by the JTAG port and are ready to receive data.
If `JMBOUTIE` is set, these events cause a system NMI. In 16-bit mode, `JMBOUTIFG` is cleared automatically when data
is written to `SYSJMBO0`. In 32-bit mode, `JMBOUTIFG` is cleared automatically when data is written to both `SYSJMBO0`
and `SYSJMBO1`. In addition, the `JMBOUTIFG` can be cleared when reading `SYSSNIV`. Clearing `JMBOUTIE` disables the
NMI interrupt.

In 16-bit mode, `JMBINIFG` is set when `SYSJMBI0` is available for reading. In 32-bit mode, `JMBINIFG` is set when both
`SYSJMBI0` and `SYSJMBI1` are available for reading. If `JMBOUTIE` is set, these events cause a system NMI. In
16-bit mode, `JMBINIFG` is cleared automatically when `SYSJMBI0` is read. In 32 bit mode, `JMBINIFG` Is cleared
automatically when both `SYSJMBI0` and `SYSJMBI1` are read. In addition, the `JMBINIFG` can be cleared when reading
`SYSSNIV`. Clearing `JMBINIE` disables the NMI interrupt.
