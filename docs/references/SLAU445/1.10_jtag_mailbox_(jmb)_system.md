# 1.10 JTAG Mailbox (JMB) System

The SYS module provides the capability to exchange user data through the regular JTAG or SBW test/debug interface. The
idea behind the JMB is to have a direct interface to the CPU during debugging, programming, and test that is identical
for all MSP430 devices of this family and uses only a few or no user application resources. The JTAG interface was
chosen because it is available on all MSP430 devices and is a dedicated resource for debugging, programming, and test.

Applications of the JMB are:

- Providing entry password for device lock or unlock protection
- Run-time data exchange (RTDX)
