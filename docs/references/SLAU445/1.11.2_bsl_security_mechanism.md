# 1.11.2 BSL Security Mechanism

Two BSL signatures, BSL Signature 1 (memory location FF84h) and BSL Signature 2 (memory location FF86h) reside in FRAM
and can be used to control the behavior of the BSL. Writing 5555h to BSL Signature 1 and BSL Signature 2 disables the
BSL function and any access to the BSL memory space causes a vacant memory access as described in
Section 1.9. Most BSL commands require the BSL to be
unlocked by a user-defined password. An incorrect password erases the device memory as a security feature. Writing
AAAAh to both BSL Signature 1 and BSL Signature 2 disables this security feature. This causes a password error to be
returned by the BSL, but the device memory is not erased. In this case, unlimited password attempts are possible.
