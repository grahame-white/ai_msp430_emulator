# 1.13.1 Identifying Device Type

The value at address location 00FF0h identifies the family branch of the device. All values starting with 80h indicate
a hierarchical structure that consists of the information block and a tag-length-value (TLV) structure with the various
descriptors. Any value other than 80h at address location 00FF0h indicates that the device is of an older family and
contains a flat descriptor beginning at location 0FF0h. The information block, shown in Figure 1-17
contains the device ID, die revisions, firmware revisions, and other manufacturer and tool related information. The
descriptors contains information about the available peripherals and their subtypes and addresses and provides the
information required to build adaptive hardware drivers for operating systems.

The length of the descriptors is represented by Info_length and is computed as shown in Equation 1.

```math
\text{Length} = 2^{Info\_length} \text{ in 32-bit words}
```

**Equation 1. Descriptor Length**

For example, if Info_length = 5, then the length of the descriptors equals 128 bytes.
