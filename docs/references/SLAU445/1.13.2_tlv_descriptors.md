# 1.13.2 TLV Descriptors

The TLV descriptors follow the information block. Because the information block is always a fixed length, the start
location of the TLV descriptors is fixed for a given device family. See the device-specific data sheet for the complete
TLV structure and what descriptors are available.

The TLV descriptors are unique to their respective TLV block and are always followed by the descriptor block length.

Each TLV descriptor contains a tag field that identifies the descriptor type. Table 1-6 lists the
currently supported tags.

| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| LDTAG      | 01h        | Legacy descriptor               |

**Table 1-6. Tag Values**

Each tag field is unique to its respective descriptor and is always followed by a length field. The length field is one
byte if the tag value is 01h through 0FDh and represents the length of the descriptor in bytes. If the tag value equals
0FEh (TAGEXT), the next byte extends the tag values, and the following two bytes represent the length of the descriptor
in bytes. In this way, a user can search through the TLV descriptor table for a particular tag value using a routine
similar to the following, which is written in pseudo code:

```c
// Identify the descriptor ID (d_ID_value) for the TLV descriptor of interest:
descriptor_address = TLV_START address;
while ( value_at_descriptor_address != d_ID_value && descriptor_address != TLV_TAGEND && descriptor_address < TLV_END)
{
  // Point to next descriptor
  descriptor_address = descriptor_address + (length of the current TLV block) + 2;
}
if (value at descriptor_address == d_ID_value) {
  // Appropriate TLV descriptor has been found!
  Return length of descriptor & descriptor_address as the location of the TLV descriptor
} else {
  // No TLV descriptor found with a matching d_ID_value
  Return a failing condition
}
```
