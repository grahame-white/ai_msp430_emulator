# 1.13.3.1 1.5-V Reference Calibration

The calibration data consists a word for reference voltage available (1.5 V). The reference voltages are measured at
room temperature. The measured values are normalized by 1.5 V before being stored into the TLV structure:

<a id="equation-2"></a>

```math
Factor_{gain\_1.5Vref} = \frac{V_{REF+}}{1.5V} \times 2^{15}
```

**Equation 2. Gain Calibration Factor**

In this way, a conversion result is corrected by multiplying it with the _Factor<sub>gain_1.5Vref</sub>_ and dividing
the result by 2<sup>15</sup> as shown for each of the respective reference voltages:

<a id="equation-3"></a>

```math
ADC_{calibrated} = ADC_{raw} \times Factor_{gain\_1.5Vref} \times \frac{1}{2^{15}}
```

**Equation 3. ADC Calibration**

In the following example, the integrated 1.5-V reference voltage is used during a conversion.

- Conversion result: 0x0100 = 256 decimal
- Reference voltage calibration factor (_Factor<sub>gain_1.5Vref</sub>_) : 0x7BBB

The following steps show how the ADC conversion result can be corrected:

- Multiply the conversion result by 2 (this step simplifies the final division): 0x0100 x 0x0002 = 0x0200
- Multiply the result by _Factor<sub>gain_1.5Vref</sub>_: 0x200 x 0x7BBB = 0x00F7_7600
- Divide the result by 2<sup>16</sup>: 0x00F7_7600 / 0x0001_0000 = 0x0000_00F7 = 247 decimal
