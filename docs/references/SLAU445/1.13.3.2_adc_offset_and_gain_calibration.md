# 1.13.3.2 ADC Offset and Gain Calibration

The offset of the ADC is determined and stored as a twos-complement number in the TLV structure. The offset error
correction is done by adding the _ADC<sub>offset</sub>_ to the conversion result.

<a id="equation-4"></a>

```math
ADC_{offset\_calibrated} = ADC_{raw} + ADC_{offset}
```

**Equation 4. ADC Offset Calibration**

The gain factor of the ADC is calculated by [Equation 5](#equation-5):

<a id="equation-5"></a>

```math
Factor_{gain} = \frac{1}{Gain} \times 2^{15}
```

**Equation 5. Gain Calibration Factor**

The conversion result is gain corrected by multiplying it with the _Factor<sub>gain</sub>_ and dividing the result by
2<sup>15</sup>:

<a id="equation-6"></a>

```math
ADC_{gain\_calibrated} = ADC_{raw} \times Factor_{gain} \times \frac{1}{2^{15}}
```

**Equation 6. ADC Gain Calibration**

If both gain and offset are corrected, the gain correction is done first:

<a id="equation-7"></a>

```math
ADC_{calibrated} = ADC_{raw} \times Factor_{gain} \times \frac{1}{2^{15}} + ADC_{offset}
```
