# 1.13.3.3 Temperature Sensor Calibration

The temperature sensor is calibrated using the internal voltage references. The 1.5V reference voltage contains a
measured value for two temperatures, room temperature (typically, the value is 30°C) and high temperature (85°C or
105°C; see the device-specific data sheet for details), which are stored in the TLV structure. The characteristic
equation of the temperature sensor voltage, in mV is:

<a id="equation-8"></a>

```math
V_{SENSE} = TC_{SENSOR} \times Temperature + V_{SENSOR}
```

**Equation 8. Temperature Sensor Equation**

The temperature coefficient, _TC<sub>SENSOR</sub>_, in mV/°C, represents the slope of the equation.
_V<sub>SENSOR</sub>_, in mV, represents the y-intercept of the equation. _Temp_, in °C, is the temperature of interest.

The temperature (_Temp_, °C) can be computed as follows for each of the reference voltages used in the ADC measurement:

<a id="equation-9"></a>

```math
Temperature = (ADC_{raw} - ADC_{30°C\_1.5V\_ref}) \times \left(\frac{55°C}{ADC_{85°C\_1.5V\_ref} - ADC_{30°C\_1.5V\_ref}}\right) + 30°C
```

**Equation 9. Temperature Sensor Calibration 85°C**

<a id="equation-10"></a>

```math
Temperature = (ADC_{raw} - ADC_{30°C\_1.5V\_ref}) \times \left(\frac{75°C}{ADC_{105°C\_1.5V\_ref} - ADC_{30°C\_1.5V\_ref}}\right) + 30°C
```

**Equation 10. Temperature Sensor Calibration 105°C**
