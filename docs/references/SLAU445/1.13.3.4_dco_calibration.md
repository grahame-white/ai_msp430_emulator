# 1.13.3.4 DCO Calibration

The DCO calibration is stored for a quick setting to maximum DCO frequency (for example, 16 MHz) at room temperature.
Loading this value to the `CSCTL0` register significantly reduces the FLL lock time when the MCU reboot or exits from a
low-power mode. If a possible frequency overshoot caused by temperature drift is expected after exit from an LPM, TI
recommends dividing the DCO frequency before use. For more details, see
Section 1.4.4.
