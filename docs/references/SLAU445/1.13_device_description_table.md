# 1.13 Device Descriptor Table

Each device provides a data structure in memory that allows an unambiguous identification of the device as well as a
description of the available modules on a given device. SYS provides this information and can be used by
device-adaptive software tools and libraries to clearly identify a particular device and all of its modules and
capabilities. The validity of the device descriptor can be verified by cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The CRC checksum
covers a device-specific TLV range. See the TLV table in the device-specific data sheet for the definitions.
Figure 1-17 shows the logical order and structure of the device descriptor table. The complete device
descriptor table and its contents can be found in the device-specific data sheet.
