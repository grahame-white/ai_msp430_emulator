**Detailed Field Descriptions:**
**`JMBOUTIFG` (Bit 7)**: JTAG mailbox output interrupt flag

- `0b` = No interrupt pending. When in 16-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 0), this bit is cleared
  automatically when `SYSJMBO0` has been written with a new message to the JTAG module by the
  `CPU`. When in 32-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 1), this bit is cleared automatically when both
  `SYSJMBO0` and `SYSJMBO1` have been written with new messages to the JTAG module by the `CPU`.
  This bit is also cleared when the associated vector in `SYSUNIV` has been read.
- `1b` = Interrupt pending, `SYSJMBOx` registers are ready for new messages. In 16-bit mode
  (`JMBMODE` = 0), `SYSJMBO0` has been received by the JTAG module and is ready for a new message
  from the `CPU`. In 32-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 1), `SYSJMBO0` and `SYSJMBO1` have been received by
  the JTAG module and are ready for new messages from the `CPU`.

**`JMBINIFG` (Bit 6)**: JTAG mailbox input interrupt flag

- `0b` = No interrupt pending. When in 16-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 0), this bit is cleared
  automatically when `JMBI0` is read by the `CPU`. When in 32-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 1), this bit
  is cleared automatically when both `JMBI0` and `JMBI1` have been read by the `CPU`. This bit is
  also cleared when the associated vector in `SYSUNIV` has been read
- `1b` = Interrupt pending, a message is waiting in the `SYSJMBIx` registers. In 16-bit mode
  (`JMBMODE` = 0) when `JMBI0` has been written by the JTAG module. In 32-bit mode (`JMBMODE` = 1)
  when `JMBI0` and `JMBI1` have been written by the JTAG module.

**`NMIIFG` (Bit 4)**: NMI pin interrupt flag

- `0b` = No interrupt pending
- `1b` = Interrupt pending

**`VMAIFG` (Bit 3)**: Vacant memory access interrupt flag

- `0b` = No interrupt pending
- `1b` = Interrupt pending

**`OFIFG` (Bit 1)**: Oscillator fault interrupt flag

- `0b` = No interrupt pending
- `1b` = Interrupt pending

**`WDTIFG` (Bit 0)**: Watchdog timer interrupt flag. In watchdog mode, `WDTIFG` self clears upon a
watchdog timeout event. The `SYSRSTIV` can be read to determine if the reset was caused by a
watchdog timeout event. In interval mode, `WDTIFG` is reset automatically by servicing the
interrupt, or can be reset by software. Because other bits in `SFRIFG1` may be used for other
modules, it is recommended to set or clear `WDTIFG` by using `BIS.B` or `BIC.B` instructions,
rather than `MOV.B` or `CLR.B` instructions.

- `0b` = No interrupt pending
- `1b` = Interrupt pending
