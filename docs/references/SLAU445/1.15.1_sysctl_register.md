**Detailed Field Descriptions:**

**`SYSJTAGPIN` (Bit 5)**: Dedicated JTAG pins enable. Setting this bit disables the shared digital
functionality of the JTAG pins and permanently enables the JTAG function. This bit can only be set
once. After the bit is set, it remains set until a BOR occurs.

- `0b` = Shared JTAG pins (JTAG mode selectable by JTAG/SBW sequence)
- `1b` = Dedicated JTAG pins (explicit 4-wire JTAG mode selection)

**`SYSBSLIND` (Bit 4)**: BSL entry indication. This bit indicates a BSL entry sequence detected on
the Spy-Bi-Wire pins.

- `0b` = No BSL entry sequence detected
- `1b` = BSL entry sequence detected

**`SYSPMMPE` (Bit 2)**: `PMM` access protect. This controls the accessibility of the `PMM` control
registers. After the bit is set to 1, it only can be cleared by a BOR.

- `0b` = Access from anywhere in memory
- `1b` = Access only from the protected BSL segments

**`SYSRIVECT` (Bit 0)**: RAM-based interrupt vectors

- `0b` = Interrupt vectors generated with end address TOP of lower 64KB of `FRAM` FFFFh
- `1b` = Interrupt vectors generated with end address TOP of RAM
