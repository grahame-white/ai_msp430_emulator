**Detailed Field Descriptions:**
**`SYSBSLPE` (Bit 15)**: Bootloader memory protection enable. By default, this bit is cleared by

hardware with a BOR event (as indicated above); however, the boot code that checks for an available
BSL may set this bit in software to protect the BSL. Because devices normally come with a TI BSL
preprogrammed and protected, the boot code sets this bit.
- `0b` = Area not protected. Read, program, and erase of BSL memory is possible.
- `1b` = Area protected

**`SYSBSLOFF` (Bit 14)**: Bootloader memory disable

- `0b` = BSL memory is addressed when this area is read.
- `1b` = BSL memory behaves like vacant memory. Reads cause 3FFFh to be read. Fetches cause JMP $
  to be executed.

**`SYSBSLR` (Bit 2)**: RAM assigned to BSL

- `0b` = No RAM assigned to BSL area
- `1b` = Lowest 16 bytes of RAM assigned to BSL
