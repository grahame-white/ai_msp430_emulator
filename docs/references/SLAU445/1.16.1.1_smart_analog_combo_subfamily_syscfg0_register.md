**Detailed Field Descriptions:**
**`FRWPPW` (Bits 15-8)**: FRAM protection password. Write with 0A5h to unlock the FRAM protection

registers. Always reads as 096h.

**`FRWPOA` (Bits 7-2)**: Program FRAM write protection offset address from the beginning of Program

FRAM. The offset increases by 1kB resolution.

- `000000b` = The write protection starting from the beginning of Program FRAM; the entire Program
  FRAM under `PFWP` protection.
- `000001b` = The FRAM program memory is unprotected (read/write) between the beginning of program
  FRAM and the beginning of program FRAM + 1024 B. The remainder of the program FRAM is protected
  by the `PFWP` protection.
- `000010b` = The FRAM program memory is unprotected (read/write) between the beginning of program
  FRAM and the beginning of program FRAM + 2048 B. The remainder of the program FRAM is protected
  by the `PFWP` protection.
- `000011b` = The FRAM program memory is unprotected (read/write) between the beginning of program
  FRAM and the beginning of program FRAM + 3072 B. The remainder of the program FRAM is protected
  by the `PFWP` protection.
- `000100b` = The FRAM program memory is unprotected (read/write) between the beginning of program
  FRAM and the beginning of program FRAM + 4096 B. The remainder of the program FRAM is protected
  by the `PFWP` protection.
- ...
- `111111b` = The FRAM program memory is unprotected (read/write) between the beginning of program
  FRAM and the beginning of program FRAM + 64512 B. The remainder of the program FRAM is protected
  by the `PFWP` protection.

**`DFWP` (Bit 1)**: Data (Information) FRAM write protection

- `0b` = Data (Information) FRAM write enable
- `1b` = Data (Information) FRAM write protected (not writable)

**`PFWP` (Bit 0)**: Program (Main) FRAM write protection

- `0b` = Program (Main) FRAM write enable
- `1b` = Program (Main) FRAM write protected (not writable)

(1) The password must be written with the FRAM protection bits in a word in a single operation.

(2) These bits are valid only in the MSP430FR235x and MSP430FR215x devices.
