# 1.2.1 Device Initial Conditions After System Reset

After a BOR, the initial device conditions are:

- The R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin is configured in the reset mode. See Section 1.7 on configuring the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin.
- I/O pins are set to input mode as described in the Digital I/O chapter.
- Other peripheral modules and registers are initialized as described in their respective chapters in this manual.
- Status register `SR` is reset.
- The watchdog timer powers up active in watchdog mode.
- Program counter `PC` is loaded with the boot code address and boot code execution begins at that
  address. Upon completion of the boot code, the `PC` is loaded with the address contained at the
  SYSRSTIV reset location (0FFFEh).

After a system reset, user software must initialize the device for the application requirements. The following must occur:

- Initialize the stack pointer `SP`, typically to the top of RAM.
- Initialize the watchdog to the requirements of the application.
- Configure peripheral modules to the requirements of the application.
