# 1.2 System Reset and Initialization

Figure 1-1 shows the system reset circuitry, which sources a brownout reset (BOR), a power on reset (POR), and a power up clear (PUC). Different events trigger these reset signals and different initial conditions exist depending on which signal was generated.

A BOR is a device reset. A BOR is only generated by the following events:

- Powering up the device
- Low signal on R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin when configured in the reset mode
- Wake-up event from LPMx.5 (LPM3.5 or LPM4.5) modes
- SVS<sub>H</sub> low condition, when enabled (see the PMM chapter for details)
- Software BOR event

A POR is always generated when a BOR is generated, but a BOR is not generated by a POR. The following events trigger a POR:

- BOR signal
- Software POR event

A PUC is always generated when a POR is generated, but a POR is not generated by a PUC. The following events trigger a PUC:

- POR signal
- Watchdog timer expiration when in watchdog mode only (see the WDT_A chapter for details)
- Watchdog timer password violation (see the WDT_A chapter for details)
- FRAM memory password violation (see the FRAM Controller chapter for details)
- Power Management Module password violation (see the PMM chapter for details)
- Fetch from peripheral area

> [!NOTE]
> The number and type of resets available may vary from device to device. See the device-specific data sheet for all reset sources that are available.
