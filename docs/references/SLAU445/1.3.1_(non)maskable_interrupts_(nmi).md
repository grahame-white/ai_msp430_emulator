# 1.3.1 (Non)Maskable Interrupts (NMIs)

In general, NMIs are not masked by the general interrupt enable (`GIE`) bit.
The family supports two levels of NMIs: system NMI (SNMI) and user NMI (UNMI).
The NMI sources are enabled by individual interrupt enable bits.
When an NMI interrupt is accepted, other NMIs of that level are automatically disabled to prevent
nesting of consecutive NMIs of the same level.
Program execution begins at the address stored in the NMI vector as shown in Table 1-1.
To allow software backward compatibility to users of earlier MSP430 families, the software may, but
does not need to, reenable NMI sources.

A UNMI interrupt can be generated by following sources:

- An edge on the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin when configured in NMI mode
- An oscillator fault occurs

A SNMI interrupt can be generated by following sources:

- FRAM errors (see the FRAM Controller chapter for details)
- Vacant memory access
- JTAG mailbox (JMB) event

> [!NOTE]
> The number and types of NMI sources may vary from device to device. See the device-specific data
> sheet for all NMI sources available.
