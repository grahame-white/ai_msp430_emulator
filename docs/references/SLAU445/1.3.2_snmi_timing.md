# 1.3.2 SNMI Timing

Consecutive SNMIs that occur at a higher rate than they can be handled (interrupt storm) allow the main
program to execute one instruction after the SNMI handler is finished with a `RETI` instruction, before
the SNMI handler is executed again. Consecutive SNMIs are not interrupted by UNMIs in this case. This
avoids a blocking behavior on high SNMI rates.
