# 1.3.3 Maskable Interrupts

Maskable interrupts are caused by peripherals with interrupt capability. Each maskable interrupt
source can be disabled individually by an interrupt enable bit, or all maskable interrupts can be
disabled by the general interrupt enable (`GIE`) bit in the status register (`SR`).

Each individual peripheral interrupt is discussed in its respective module chapter in this manual.
