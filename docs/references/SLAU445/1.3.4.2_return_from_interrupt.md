### 1.3.4.2 Return From Interrupt

The interrupt handling routine terminates with the instruction:

```asm
RETI ; Return from an interrupt service routine
```

The return from the interrupt takes five cycles to execute the following actions and is shown in Figure 1-4.

1. The `SR` with all previous settings pops from the stack. All previous settings of `GIE`, `CPUOFF`,
   and the other bits are now in effect, regardless of the settings used during the interrupt service
   routine.
1. The `PC` pops from the stack and begins execution where it was interrupted.
