# 1.3.6.1 Alternate Interrupt Vectors

On devices that contain RAM, the RAM can be used as an alternate location for the interrupt vector
locations. Setting the `SYSRIVECT` bit in `SYSCTL` causes the interrupt vectors to be re-mapped to the
top of RAM. When the bit is set, any interrupt vectors to the alternate locations now residing in RAM.

Because `SYSRIVECT` is automatically cleared on a BOR, it is critical that the reset vector at location
0FFFEh still be available and handled properly in firmware.
