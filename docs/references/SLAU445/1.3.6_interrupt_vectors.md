# 1.3.6 Interrupt Vectors

The interrupt vectors are in the address range `0FFFFh` to `0FF80h`, for a maximum of 64 interrupt
sources. A vector is programmed by the user and points to the start location of the corresponding
interrupt service routine. Table 1-1 is an example of the interrupt vectors that are available. See the
device-specific data sheet for the complete interrupt vector list.

**Table 1-1. Interrupt Sources, Flags, and Vectors**

Some interrupt enable bits, interrupt flags, and the control bits for the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin are located in
the special function registers SFRs. The SFRs are located in the peripheral address range and are byte
and word accessible. See the device-specific datasheet for the SFR configuration.
