# 1.3.7 SYS Interrupt Vector Generators

SYS collects all system NMI (SNMI) sources, user NMI (UNMI) sources, and BOR, POR, PUC (reset) sources of all the other modules. They are combined into three interrupt vectors. The interrupt vector registers `SYSRSTIV`, `SYSSNIV`, `SYSUNIV` are used to determine which flags requested an interrupt or a reset. The interrupt with the highest priority of a group, when enabled, generates a number in the corresponding `SYSRSTIV`, `SYSSNIV`, `SYSUNIV` register. This number can be directly added to the program counter, causing a branch to the appropriate portion of the interrupt service routine. Disabled interrupts do not affect the `SYSRSTIV`, `SYSSNIV`, `SYSUNIV` values. Reading `SYSRSTIV`, `SYSSNIV`, `SYSUNIV` register automatically resets the highest pending interrupt flag of that register. If another interrupt flag is set, another interrupt is immediately generated after servicing the initial interrupt. Writing to the `SYSRSTIV`, `SYSSNIV`, `SYSUNIV` register automatically resets all pending interrupt flags of the group.
