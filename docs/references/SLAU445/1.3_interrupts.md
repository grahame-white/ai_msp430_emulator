# 1.3 Interrupts

The interrupt priorities are fixed and defined by the arrangement of the modules in the connection chain as shown in Figure 1-2. Interrupt priorities determine which interrupt is acted on when more than one interrupt is pending simultaneously.

There are three types of interrupts:

- System reset
- (Non)maskable
- Maskable

> [!NOTE]
> The types of interrupt sources available and their respective priorities can change from device to device. See the device-specific data sheet for all interrupt sources and their priorities.

> [!NOTE]
> A device that is unprogrammed or blank is defined as having its reset vector value, at memory address FFFEh, equal to FFFFh.
> Upon system reset of a blank device, the device automatically enters operating mode LPM4.
> See Section 1.4 for information on operating modes and Section 1.3.6 for details on interrupt vectors.
