# 1.4.1 Low-Power Modes and Clock Requests

A peripheral module request its clock sources automatically from the clock system (CS) module if it is required for its
proper operation, regardless of the current power mode of operation. For details, see Section 3.2.12.

Because of the clock request mechanism the system might not reach the low-power modes requested by the bits set in the
CPU status register, `SR`, as listed in [Table 1-3](#table-1-3).

| Requested (`SR` Bits<br>According to Table 1-2) | Actual LPM<br>If No Clock Requested | Actual LPM<br>If Only ACLK Requested | Actual LPM<br>If SMCLK Requested |
