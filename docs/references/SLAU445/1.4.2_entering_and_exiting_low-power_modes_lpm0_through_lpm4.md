# 1.4.2 Entering and Exiting Low-Power Modes LPM0 Through LPM4

An enabled interrupt event wakes the device from low-power operating modes LPM0 through LPM4. The program flow for
exiting LPM0 through LPM4 is:

- Enter interrupt service routine
  - The `PC` and `SR` are stored on the stack.
  - The `CPUOFF`, `SCG1`, and `OSCOFF` bits are automatically reset.
- Options for returning from the interrupt service routine
  - The original `SR` is popped from the stack, restoring the previous operating mode.
  - The `SR` bits stored on the stack can be modified within the interrupt service routine to return to a different
    operating mode when the `RETI` instruction is executed.

```asm
; Enter LPM0 Example
 BIS #GIE + CPUOFF, SR               ; Enter LPM0
; ...                                ; Program stops here
;
; Exit LPM0 Interrupt Service Routine
 BIC #CPUOFF, 0(SP)                  ; Exit LPM0 on RETI
 RETI
```

```asm
; Enter LPM3 Example
 BIS #GIE + CPUOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, SR ; Enter LPM3
; ...                                ; Program stops here
;
; Exit LPM3 Interrupt Service Routine
 BIC #CPUOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, 0(SP)    ; Exit LPM3 on RETI
 RETI
```

```asm
; Enter LPM4 Example
 BIS #GIE + CPUOFF + OSCOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, SR ; Enter LPM4
; ...                                         ; Program stops here
;
; Exit LPM4 Interrupt Service Routine
 BIC #CPUOFF + OSCOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, 0(SP)    ; Exit LPM4 on RETI
 RETI
```
