# 1.4.3.2 Exit From LPMx.5

The following conditions cause an exit from LPMx.5:

- A wake-up event on an I/O, if configured and enabled. The interrupt flag of the corresponding port pin is set
  (`PxIFG`). The `PMMLPM5IFG` bit is set.
- A wake-up event from the RTC, if enabled. The corresponding interrupt flag in the RTC is set. The `PMMLPM5IFG` bit is
  set.
- A wake-up signal from the R̅S̅T̅ pin.
- A power cycle. Either the `SVSHIFG` or none of the `PMMIFG`s is set.

Any exit from LPMx.5 causes a BOR. The program execution starts at the address the reset vector points to.
`PMMLPM5IFG` = 1 indicates a wakeup from LPMx.5 or the System Reset Vector Word register `SYSRSTIV` can be used to
decode the reset condition (see the device-specific data sheet). After wakeup from LPMx.5, the state of the I/Os and
the modules connected to the RTC LDO are locked and remain unchanged until you clear the `LOCKLPM5` bit in the
`PM5CTL0` register.
