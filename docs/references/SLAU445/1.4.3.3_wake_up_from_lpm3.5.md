# 1.4.3.3 Wake up from LPM3.5

Do the following steps after a wakeup from LPM3.5:

1. Initialize the registers of the modules connected to the RTC LDO exactly the same way as they were configured before
   the device entered LPM3.5 but do not enable the interrupts.
1. Initialize the port registers exactly the same way as they were configured before the device entered LPM3.5 but do
   not enable port interrupts.
1. If the LF-crystal-oscillator was used in LPM3.5 the corresponding I/Os must be configured as `LFXIN` and `LFXOUT`.
   The LF-crystal-oscillator must be enabled in the clock system (see the clock system chapter).
1. Clear the `LOCKLPM5` bit in the `PM5CTL0` register.
1. Enable port interrupts as necessary.
1. Enable module interrupts.
1. After enabling the port and module interrupts, the wake-up interrupt is serviced as a normal interrupt.
