# 1.4.3.4 Wake up from LPM4.5

Do the following steps after a wakeup from LPM4.5:

1. Initialize the port registers exactly the same way as they were configured before the device entered LPM4.5 but do
   not enable port interrupts.
2. Clear the `LOCKLPM5` bit in the `PM5CTL0` register.
3. Enable port interrupts as necessary.
4. After enabling the port interrupts, the wake-up interrupt is serviced as a normal interrupt.

If a crystal oscillator is needed after a wakeup from LPM4.5 then configure the corresponding pins and start the
oscillator after you cleared the `LOCKLPM5` bit.
