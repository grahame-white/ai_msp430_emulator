# 1.4.4 Extended Time in Low-Power Modes

The temperature coefficient of the DCO should be considered when the DCO is disabled for extended low power mode
periods. If the temperature changes significantly, the DCO frequency at wakeup may be significantly different from when
the low-power mode was entered and may be out of the specified range. To avoid this, the DCO output can be divided by
two before entering the low-power mode for extended periods of time where temperature can change.

```asm
; Enter LPM3 Example with DCO/2 settings (to be updated upon the completion of CS module)
 MOV #FLLD0 + FLLN                            ; Set DCO Output divided by 2
 BIS #GIE + CPUOFF + OSCOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, SR ; Enter LPM3
; ...                                         ; Program stops
;
; Interrupt Service Routine
 BIC #CPUOFF + OSCOFF + SCG1 + SCG0, 0(SR)    ; Exit LPM3 on RETI
 RETI
