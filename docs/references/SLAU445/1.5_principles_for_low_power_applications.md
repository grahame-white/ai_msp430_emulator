# 1.5 Principles for Low-Power Applications

Often, the most important factor for reducing power consumption is using the device clock system to maximize the time
in LPM3 or LPM4 mode whenever possible.

- Use interrupts to wake the processor and control program flow.
- Peripherals should be switched on only when needed.
- Use low-power integrated peripheral modules in place of software-driven functions. For example, Timer_A and Timer_B
  can automatically generate PWM and capture external timing with no CPU resources.
- Calculated branching and fast table look-ups should be used in place of flag polling and long software calculations.
- Avoid frequent subroutine and function calls due to overhead.
- For longer software routines, single-cycle CPU registers should be used.

If the application has low duty cycle and slow response time events, maximizing time in LPMx.5 can further reduce power
consumption significantly.
