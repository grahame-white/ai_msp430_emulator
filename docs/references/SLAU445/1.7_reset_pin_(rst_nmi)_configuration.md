# 1.7 Reset Pin (R̅S̅T̅/NMI) Configuration

The reset pin can be configured as a reset function (default) or as an NMI function by the Special Function Register
(SFR), `SFRRPCR`. Setting `SYSNMI` causes the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin to be configured as an external NMI source. The external
NMI is edge sensitive and its edge is selectable by `SYSNMIIES`. Setting the `NMIIE` enables the interrupt of the
external NMI. Upon an external NMI event, the `NMIIFG` is set.

The R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin can have either a pullup or pulldown present or not. `SYSRSTUP` selects either pullup or pulldown
and `SYSRSTRE` causes the pullup or pulldown to be enabled or not. If the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin is unused, it is required to
have either the internal pullup selected and enabled or an external resistor connected to the R̅S̅T̅/NMI pin as shown
in Table 1-4.

There is a digital filter that suppresses short pulses on the reset pin to avoid unintended resets of the device. The
minimum reset pulse duration is specified in the device-specific data sheet. The filter is active only if the pin is
configured in its reset function. It is disabled if the pin is used as external NMI source.
