# 1.8 Configuring JTAG Pins

The JTAG pins are shared with general-purpose I/O pins. There are several ways that the JTAG pins can be selected for
4-wire JTAG mode in software. Normally, upon a BOR, `SYSJTAGPIN` is cleared. With `SYSJTAGPIN` cleared, the JTAG are
configured as general-purpose I/O. See the Digital I/O chapter for details on controlling the JTAG pins as
general-purpose I/O. If `SYSJTAG` = 1, the JTAG pins are configured to 4-wire JTAG mode and remain in this mode until
another BOR condition occurs. Therefore, `SYSJTAGPIN` is a write only once function. Clearing it by software is not
possible, and the device does not change from 4-wire JTAG mode to general-purpose I/O.
