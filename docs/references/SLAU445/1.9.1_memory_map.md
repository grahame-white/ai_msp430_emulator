# 1.9.1 Memory Map

This memory map represents the MSP430FR2xx and MSP430FR4xx devices. Although the address ranges differ from device to
device, overall behavior remains the same.

| Address Range    | Name and Usage                        | Properties | Segment erase by user possible | Bank erase by user possible | Always able to access `PMM` registers from (1), Mass erase by user possible | Protectable for read and write accesses | Generates PUC on fetch access | Can generate NMI on read, write, or fetch |
