# 1.9.1 Memory Map

This memory map represents the MSP430FR2xx and MSP430FR4xx devices. Although the address ranges differ from device to device, overall behavior remains the same.

**Legend:**
- **Properties**: "x" indicates FRAM memory
- **Special Features**:
  - **Segment/Bank erase**: Segment erase by user possible / Bank erase by user possible
  - **Mass erase**: Mass erase by user possible / Always able to access PMM registers from (1)
  - **PMM access**: Always able to access PMM registers from (1)
  - **Protectable**: Protectable for read and write accesses
  - **PUC on fetch**: Generates PUC on fetch access
  - **NMI**: Can generate NMI on read, write, or fetch

- (1) Access rights are separately programmable for SYS and `PMM`.
- (2) On vacant memory space, the value 03FFFh is driven on the data bus.
- (3) Fixed ID for all MSP430 devices. See Section 1.13.1 for further details.
