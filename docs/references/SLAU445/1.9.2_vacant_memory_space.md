# 1.9.2 Vacant Memory Space

Vacant memory is nonexistent memory space. Accesses to vacant memory space generate a system (non)maskable interrupt
(SNMI), when the interrupt is enabled (`VMAIE` = 1). Reads from vacant memory result in the value 3FFFh. In the case of
a fetch, this is taken as JMP $. Fetch accesses from vacant peripheral space result in a PUC. After the boot code is
executed, the boot code memory space behaves like vacant memory space and also causes an NMI on access.
