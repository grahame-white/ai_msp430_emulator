# 1.9.3 FRAM Write Protection

FRAM write protection allows the user to prevent any unwanted write protection to FRAM contents. The SYS module offers
two separate write protection.

- User program FRAM protection always used to store user main program and constant data protected by the `PFWP` bit in
  the `SYSCFG0` register
- User data FRAM protection always fixed from 1800h to 18FFh or 19FFh (see the device-specific data sheet on info
  memory) and protected by the `DFWP` bit in the `SYSCFG0` register
- Before FRAM access, the write-protect password must be written together with the program or data FRAM protection bit;
  see the device-specific `SYSCFG0` register in
  Section 1.16 for details.

When write protection is enabled, any write access to the protected FRAM causes an invalid write operation but does not
generate an interrupt or reset. TI recommends enabling write protection at the beginning of the user initialization
routine. To write data to FRAM, write the data as soon as the write protection is disabled, and then immediately enable
write protection again when the write is complete.

> [!CAUTION]
> To protect the program stored in FRAM from unintended writes, FRAM write protection must be enabled at all times,
> except when an intentional write operation is performed. The write operation should be completed within as short a
> time as possible with interrupts disabled to reduce the risk of an unintended write operation.
