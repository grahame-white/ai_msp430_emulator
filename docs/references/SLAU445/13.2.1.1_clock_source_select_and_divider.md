# 13.2.1.1 Clock Source Select and Divider

The timer clock can be sourced from ACLK, SMCLK, or externally from TAxCLK or INCLK. The clock source is
selected with the TASSEL bits. The selected clock source may be passed directly to the timer or divided by 2, 4,
or 8, using the ID bits. The selected clock source can be further divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 using the
TAIDEX bits. The timer clock divider logic is reset when TACLR is set.

> [!NOTE] **Timer_A dividers**
> <br>
> The timer clock dividers are reset by the TACLR bit. The clock divider is implemented as a down counter. To reset
the down counter's state, write one to the TACLR bit in Stop mode. When the timer starts counting, the timer clock
begins clocking at the first rising edge of the Timer_A clock source selected with the TASSEL bits and continues
clocking at the divider setting set by the ID and TAIDEX bits.
> <br>
> The clock divider (ID bits and TAIDEX bits) should not be changed while the timer is running. It could cause
unexpected behaviors. Stop the timer first (MC = 0) when changing the ID bits or TAIDEX bits.
