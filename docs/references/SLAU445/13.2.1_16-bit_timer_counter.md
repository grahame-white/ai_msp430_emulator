# 13.2.1 16-Bit Timer Counter

The 16-bit timer/counter register, TAxR, increments or decrements (depending on mode of operation) with each
rising edge of the clock signal. TAxR can be read or written with software. Additionally, the timer can generate
an interrupt when it overflows.

> [!NOTE] **Accessing TAxR**
> <br>
> Care must be taken when accessing TAxR. If TAxR is accessed (read or write) by the CPU while the timer is
running, the value read from TAxR or the value written to TAxR could be unpredictable. To avoid this uncertainty,
the timer should be stopped by writing the MC bits to zero before accessing TAxR. For read, alternatively TAxR can
be read multiple times while the timer is running, and a majority vote taken in software to determine the correct
reading.
