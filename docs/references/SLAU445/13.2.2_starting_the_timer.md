# 13.2.2 Starting the Timer

When the device is out of reset (BOR or POR), the timer is at stop condition and all registers have default values. To start the timer from the default condition, perform the following steps:

1. Write 1 to the TACLR bit (TACLR = 1) to clear TAxR, clock divider state, and the counter direction.
2. If necessary, write initial counter value to TAxR.
3. Initialize TAxCCRn.
4. Apply desired configuration to TAxIV, TAIDEX and TAxCCTLn.
5. Apply desired configuration to TAxCTL including to MC bits.
