# 13.2.3.1.1 Changing Period Register TAxCCR0

When the MC bits are configured to Up mode (MC = 1) from Stop mode (MC = 0), the timer starts counting up from
the value in TAxR if the TAxCCR0 is greater than TAxR. If TAxCCR0 is less than TAxR or equal to TAxR, the timer
rolls back to zero and then counts up to TAxCCR0. One additional count may occur before the counter rolls to zero.

Changing TAxCCR0 while the timer is running may result in unexpected behaviors. To avoid the uncertainty, TAxCCR0
should be updated in Stop mode (MC = 0).
