# 13.2.3.2 Continuous Mode

In the Continuous mode, the timer repeatedly counts up to 0FFFFh and restarts from zero as shown in Figure 13-4. The capture/compare register TAxCCR0 works the same way as the other capture/compare registers.

The TAIFG interrupt flag is set when the timer counts from 0FFFFh to zero. Figure 13-5 shows the flag set cycle.
