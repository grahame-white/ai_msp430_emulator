# 13.2.3.3 Use of Continuous Mode

The Continuous mode can be used to generate independent time intervals and output frequencies. Each time an interval
is completed, an interrupt is generated. The next time interval is added to the TAxCCRn register in the interrupt
service routine. Figure 13-6 shows two separate time intervals, t<sup>0</sup> and t<sup>1</sup> , being added to the
capture/compare registers. In this usage, the time interval is controlled by hardware, not software, without impact
from interrupt latency. Up to n (where n = 0 to 6), independent time intervals or output frequencies can be generated
using capture/compare registers.

**Figure 13-6. Continuous Mode Time Intervals**

Time intervals can be produced with other modes as well, where TAxCCR0 is used as the period register. Their handling is more complex because the sum of the old TAxCCRn data and the new period can be higher than the TAxCCR0 value. When the previous TAxCCRn value plus t<sup>x</sup> is greater than the TAxCCR0 data, the TAxCCR0 value must be subtracted to obtain the correct time interval.
