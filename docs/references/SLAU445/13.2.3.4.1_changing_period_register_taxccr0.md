# 13.2.3.4.1 Changing Period Register TAxCCR0

When the MC bits is configured to Up/Down mode (MC = 3) from Stop mode, the timer starts counting up or down
depending on the previous direction. The timer keeps the previous direction regardless of the previous mode. The
direction can be forced to up direction by setting to TACLR bit in Stop mode, but the direction cannot be forced
to down direction when the timer starts with up direction, if TAxCCR0 is greater than TAxR, the timer will count
up to TAxCCR0. If TAxCCR0 is less than TAxR, or equal to TAxR, the timer begins counting down. However, one
additional count may occur before the counter begins counting down.

In Up/Down mode, updating TAxCCR0 while the timer is running may result in unexpected behaviors. To avoid the uncertainly, TAxCCR0 should be updated in Stop mode (MC = 0).
