# 13.2.3.4 Up/Down Mode

The Up/Down mode is used if the timer period must be different from 0FFFFh counts, and if symmetrical pulse
generation is needed. The timer repeatedly counts up to the value of compare register TAxCCR0 and back down to
zero (see Figure 13-7). The period is twice the value in TAxCCR0.

The count direction is latched. This allows the timer to be stopped and then restarted in the same direction it was
counting before it was stopped. If this is not desired, the TACLR bit must be set in Stop mode to clear the direction.
The TACLR bit also clears the TAxR value and the timer clock divider (the divider setting remains unchanged).

In Up/Down mode, the TAxCCR0 CCIFG interrupt flag and the TAIFG interrupt flag are set only once during a period,
separated by one-half the timer period. The TAxCCR0 CCIFG interrupt flag is set when the timer counts from TAxCCR0 â€“ 1
to TAxCCR0, and TAIFG is set when the timer completes counting down from 0001h to 0000h. Figure 13-8 shows the flag
set cycle.
