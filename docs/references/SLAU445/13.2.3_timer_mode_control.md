# 13.2.3 Timer Mode Control

The timer has four modes of operation: stop, up, continuous, and up/down (see Table 13-1). The operating mode is selected with the MC bits.

| MC  | Mode       | Description                                                                             |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 00  | Stop       | The timer is halted.                                                                    |
| 01  | Up         | The timer repeatedly counts from zero to the value of TAxCCR0                           |
| 10  | Continuous | The timer repeatedly counts from zero to 0FFFFh.                                        |
| 11  | Up/down    | The timer repeatedly counts from zero up to the value of TAxCCR0 and back down to zero. |

**Table 13-1. Timer Modes**

To move from one mode to another, first stop the timer by writing zero to the MC bits (MC = 0), then set the MC bits to the desired mode (see Table 13-1 for details).
