# 13.2.4.1.1 Capture Initiated by Software

Captures can be initiated by software. The CM bits can be set for capture on both edges. Software then sets CCIS1 = 1 and toggles bit CCIS0 to switch the capture signal between VCC and GND, initiating a capture each time CCIS0 changes state:

```asm
MOV  #CAP+SCS+CCIS1+CM_3,  &TA0CCTL1  ; Setup TA0CCTL1, synch. capture mode
                                      ; Event trigger on both edges of capture input.
XOR  #CCIS0,               &TA0CCTL1  ; TA0CCR1 = TA0R
```
