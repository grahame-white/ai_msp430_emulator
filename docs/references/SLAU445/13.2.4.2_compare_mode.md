# 13.2.4.2 Compare Mode

The compare mode is selected when CAP = 0. The compare mode is used to generate PWM output signals or interrupts at
specific time intervals. When TAxR counts to the value in a TAxCCRn, where n represents the specific capture/compare
register.

- Interrupt flag CCIFG is set.
- Internal signal EQUn = 1.
- EQUn affects the output according to the output mode.
- The input signal CCI is latched into SCCI.

> [!NOTE] **Updating TAxCCRn registers**
> <br>
> In Compare mode, the timer should be stopped by writing the MC bits to zero (MC = 0) before writing new data to
> TAxCCRn. Updating TAxCCRn while the timer is running could result in unexpected behaviors.
