# 4.2 Interrupts

The MSP430X has the following interrupt structure:

- Vectored interrupts with no polling necessary
- Interrupt vectors are located downward from address 0FFFEh.

The interrupt vectors contain 16-bit addresses that point into the lower 64KB memory. This means all interrupt
handlers must start in the lower 64KB memory.

During an interrupt, the program counter (PC) and the status register (SR) are pushed onto the stack as shown in
Figure 4-2. The MSP430X architecture stores the complete 20-bit PC value efficiently by appending the PC bits 19:16
to the stored SR value automatically on the stack. When the RETI instruction is executed, the full 20-bit PC is
restored making return from interrupt to any address in the memory range possible.
