# 4.3.2 Stack Pointer (SP)

The 20-bit Stack Pointer (SP, also called R1) is used by the CPU to store the return addresses of subroutine calls
and interrupts. It uses a predecrement, postincrement scheme. In addition, the SP can be used by software with all
instructions and addressing modes. Figure 4-5 shows the SP. The SP is initialized into RAM by the user, and is
always aligned to even addresses.

Figure 4-6 shows the stack usage. Figure 4-7 shows the stack usage when 20-bit address words are pushed.

The special cases of using the SP as an argument to the PUSH and POP instructions are described and shown in Figure 4-8.

instruction. The POP SP instruction places SP1 into the stack pointer SP (SP2 = SP1)
