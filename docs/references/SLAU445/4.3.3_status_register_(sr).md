# 4.3.3 Status Register (SR)

The 16-bit Status Register (SR, also called R2), used as a source or destination register, can only be used in
register mode addressed with word instructions. The remaining combinations of addressing modes are used to support
the constant generator. Figure 4-9 shows the SR bits. Do not write 20-bit values to the SR. Unpredictable operation
can result.

Table 4-1 describes the SR bits.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reserved  | Reserved                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| V         | Overflow. This bit is set when the result of an arithmetic operation overflows the signed-variable range.                                                                                  |
| V         | Set when:<br>positive + positive = negative<br>negative + negative = positive<br>otherwise reset<br>ADD(.B), ADDX(.B,.A),<br>ADDC(.B), ADDCX(.B.A),<br>ADDA                                |
| V         | Set when:<br>positive – negative = negative<br>negative – positive = positive<br>otherwise reset<br>SUB(.B), SUBX(.B,.A),<br>SUBC(.B),SUBCX(.B,.A),<br>SUBA, CMP(.B),<br>CMPX(.B,.A), CMPA |
| SCG1(1)   | System clock generator 1. This bit may be used to enable or disable functions in the clock system depending on<br>the device family; for example, DCO bias enable or disable.              |
| SCG0(1)   | System clock generator 0. This bit may be used to enable or disable functions in the clock system depending on<br>the device family; for example, FLL enable or disable.                   |
| OSCOFF(1) | Oscillator off. When this bit is set, it turns off the LFXT1 crystal oscillator when LFXT1CLK is not used for MCLK or SMCLK.                                                               |
| CPUOFF(1) | CPU off. When this bit is set, it turns off the CPU.                                                                                                                                       |
| GIE       | General interrupt enable. When this bit is set, it enables maskable interrupts. When it is reset, all maskable interrupts are disabled.                                                    |
| N         | Negative. This bit is set when the result of an operation is negative and cleared when the result is positive.                                                                             |
| Z         | Zero. This bit is set when the result of an operation is 0 and cleared when the result is not 0.                                                                                           |
| C         | Carry. This bit is set when the result of an operation produced a carry and cleared when no carry occurred.                                                                                |

(1) The bits CPUOFF, OSCOFF, SCG0, and SCG1 request the system to enter a low-power mode
