# 4.3.4.1 Constant Generator â€“ Expanded Instruction Set

The RISC instruction set of the MSP430 has only 27 instructions. However, the constant generator allows the MSP430
assembler to support 24 additional emulated instructions. For example, the single-operand instruction:

```asm
CLR dst
```

is emulated by the double-operand instruction with the same length:

```asm
MOV R3,dst
```

where the #0 is replaced by the assembler, and R3 is used with As = 00.

```asm
INC dst
```

is replaced by:

```asm
ADD #1,dst
```
