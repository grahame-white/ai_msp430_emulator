# 4.3.4 Constant Generator Registers (CG1 and CG2)

Six commonly-used constants are generated with the constant generator registers R2 (CG1) and R3 (CG2), without
requiring an additional 16-bit word of program code. The constants are selected with the source register addressing
modes (As), as described in Table 4-2.

| Register | As  | Constant           | Remarks               |
| -------- | --- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| R2       | 00  | –                  | Register mode         |
| R2       | 01  | (0)                | Absolute address mode |
| R2       | 10  | 00004h             | +4, bit processing    |
| R2       | 11  | 00008h             | +8, bit processing    |
| R3       | 00  | 00000h             | 0, word processing    |
| R3       | 01  | 00001h             | +1                    |
| R3       | 10  | 00002h             | +2, bit processing    |
| R3       | 11  | FFh, FFFFh, FFFFFh | –1, word processing   |

**Table 4-2. Values of Constant Generators CG1, CG2**

The constant generator advantages are:

- No special instructions required
- No additional code word for the six constants
- No code memory access required to retrieve the constant

The assembler uses the constant generator automatically if one of the six constants is used as an immediate source
operand. Registers R2 and R3, used in the constant mode, cannot be addressed explicitly; they act as source-only
registers.
