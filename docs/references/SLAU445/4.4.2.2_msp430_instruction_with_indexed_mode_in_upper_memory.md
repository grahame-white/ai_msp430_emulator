# 4.4.2.2 MSP430 Instruction With Indexed Mode in Upper Memory

If the CPU register Rn points to an address above the lower 64KB memory, the Rn bits 19:16 are used for the address calculation of the operand.
The operand may be located in memory in the range Rn Â±32KB, because the index, X, is a signed 16-bit value.
In this case, the address of the operand can overflow or underflow into the lower 64KB memory space (see Figure 4-16 and Figure 4-17).

| Start Address | End Address | Region       | Remark                 |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| 00000h        | 0FFFFh      | Lower 64 kb  |                        |
| 10000h        | FFFFFh      | Upper memory | Rn.19:0<br>Rn +/- 32kb |

## Length

Two or three words

## Operation

The sign-extended 16-bit index in the next word after the instruction is added to the 20 bits of the CPU register Rn. This delivers a 20-bit address, which points to an address in the range 0 to FFFFFh. The operand is the content of the addressed memory location.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the register index and inserts it.


## Example

`ADD.W 8346h(R5), 2100h(R6);`

This instruction adds the 16-bit data contained in the source and the destination addresses and places the 16-bit result into the destination. Source and destination operand can be located in the entire address range.

### Source

The word pointed to by R5 + 8346h. The negative index 8346h is sign extended, which results in address 23456h + F8346h = 1B79Ch.

### Destination

The word pointed to by R6 + 2100h results in address 15678h + 2100h = 17778h.
