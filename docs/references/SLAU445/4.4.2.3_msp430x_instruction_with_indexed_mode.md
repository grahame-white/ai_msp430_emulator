# 4.4.2.3 MSP430X Instruction With Indexed Mode

When using an MSP430X instruction with Indexed mode, the operand can be located anywhere in the range of Rn + 19 bits.

## Length

Three or four words

## Operation

The operand address is the sum of the 20-bit CPU register content and the 20-bit index. The 4 MSBs of the index are
contained in the extension word; the 16 LSBs are contained in the word following the instruction. The CPU register is
not modified.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the register index and<br>inserts it.

## Example

`ADDX.A 12346h(R5),32100h(R6);`

This instruction adds the 20-bit data contained in the source and the destination addresses and places the result into
the destination.

### Source

Two words pointed to by R5 + 12346h which results in address 23456h + 12346h = 3579Ch.

### Destination

Two words pointed to by R6 + 32100h which results in address 45678h + 32100h = 77778h.

The extension word contains the MSBs of the source index and of the destination index and the A/L bit for 20-bit data.
The instruction word uses byte mode due to the 20-bit data length with bits A/L:B/W = 01.
