# 4.4.3.2 MSP430 Instruction With Symbolic Mode in Upper Memory

If the PC points to an address above the lower 64KB memory, the PC bits 19:16 are used for the address calculation
of the operand. The operand may be located in memory in the range PC ± 32KB, because the index, X, is a signed
16-bit value. In this case, the address of the operand can overflow or underflow into the lower 64KB memory space
as shown in Figure 4-20 and Figure 4-21.

## Length

Two or three words

## Operation

The sign-extended 16-bit index in the next word after the instruction is added to the 20 bits of the PC. This
delivers a 20-bit address, which points to an address in the range 0 to FFFFFh. The operand is the content of the
addressed memory location.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the PC index and inserts it

## Example

`ADD.W EDE, &TONI;`

This instruction adds the 16-bit data contained in source word EDE and destination word TONI and places the 16-bit
result into the destination word TONI. For this example, the instruction is located at address 2F034h.

### Source

Word EDE at address 3379Ch, pointed to by PC + 4766h, which is the 16-bit result of 3379Ch – 2F036h = 04766h.
Address 2F036h is the location of the index for this example.

### Destination

Word TONI located at address 00778h pointed to by the absolute address 00778h
