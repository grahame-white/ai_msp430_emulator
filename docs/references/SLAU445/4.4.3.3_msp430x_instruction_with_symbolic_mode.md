# 4.4.3.3 MSP430X Instruction With Symbolic Mode

When using an MSP430X instruction with Symbolic mode, the operand can be located anywhere in the range of PC + 19 bits.

## Length

Three or four words

## Operation

The operand address is the sum of the 20-bit PC and the 20-bit index. The 4 MSBs of the index are contained in the extension word; the 16 LSBs are contained in the word following the instruction.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the register index and inserts it.

## Example

`ADDX.B EDE, TONI;`

This instruction adds the 8-bit data contained in source byte EDE and destination byte TONI and places the result into the destination byte TONI.

### Source

Byte EDE located at address 3579Ch, pointed to by PC + 14766h, is the 20-bit result of 3579Ch – 21036h = 14766h. Address 21036h is the address of the index in this example.

### Destination:

Byte TONI located at address 77778h, pointed to by PC + 56740h, is the 20-bit result of 77778h – 21038h = 56740h. Address 21038h is the address of the index in this example.
