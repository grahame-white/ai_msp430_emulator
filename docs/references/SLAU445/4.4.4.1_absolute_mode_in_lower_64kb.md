# 4.4.4.1 Absolute Mode in Lower 64KB

If an MSP430 instruction is used with Absolute addressing mode, the absolute address is a 16-bit value and, therefore, points to an address in the lower 64KB of the memory range. The address is calculated as an index from 0 and is stored in the word following the instruction. The RAM and the peripheral registers can be accessed this way and existing MSP430 software is usable without modifications.

## Length

Two or three words

## Operation

The operand is the content of the addressed memory location.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the index from 0 and inserts it.

## Example

`ADD.W &EDE, &TONI;`

This instruction adds the 16-bit data contained in the absolute source and destination addresses and places the result into the destination.

### Source

Word at address EDE

### Destination

Word at address TONI
