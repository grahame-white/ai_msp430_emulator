# 4.4.4.2 MSP430X Instruction With Absolute Mode

If an MSP430X instruction is used with Absolute addressing mode, the absolute address is a 20-bit value and, therefore,
points to any address in the memory range. The address value is calculated as an index from 0. The 4 MSBs of the
index are contained in the extension word, and the 16 LSBs are contained in the word following the instruction.

## Length

Three or four words

## Operation

The operand is the content of the addressed memory location.

## Comment

Valid for source and destination. The assembler calculates the index from 0 and inserts it.

## Example

`ADDX.A &EDE,&TONI;`

This instruction adds the 20-bit data contained in the absolute source and destination addresses and places the
result into the destination.

### Source

Two words beginning with address EDE

### Destination

Two words beginning with address TONI
