# 4.4.5 Indirect Register Mode

The Indirect Register mode uses the contents of the CPU register Rsrc as the source operand. The Indirect Register mode always uses a 20-bit address.

## Length

One, two, or three words

## Operation

The operand is the content the addressed memory location. The source register Rsrc is not modified.

## Comment

Valid only for the source operand. The substitute for the destination operand is 0(Rdst).

## Example

`ADDX.W @R5, 2100h(R6)`

This instruction adds the two 16-bit operands contained in the source and the destination addresses and places the result into the destination.

### Source

Word pointed to by R5. R5 contains address 3579Ch for this example.

### Destination

Word pointed to by R6 + 2100h, which results in address 45678h + 2100h = 7778h
