# 4.4.6 Indirect Autoincrement Mode

The Indirect Autoincrement mode uses the contents of the CPU register Rsrc as the source operand. Rsrc is then
automatically incremented by 1 for byte instructions, by 2 for word instructions, and by 4 for address-word
instructions immediately after accessing the source operand. If the same register is used for source and destination,
it contains the incremented address for the destination access. Indirect Autoincrement mode always uses 20-bit
addresses.

## Length

One, two, or three words

## Operation

The operand is the content of the addressed memory location.

## Comment

Valid only for the source operand.

## Example

`ADD.B @R5+, 0(R6)`

This instruction adds the 8-bit data contained in the source and the destination addresses and places the result
into the destination.

### Source

Byte pointed to by R5. R5 contains address 3579Ch for this example.

### Destination

Byte pointed to by R6 + 0h, which results in address 0778h for this example.
