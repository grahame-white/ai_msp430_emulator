# 4.4.7.1 MSP430 Instructions With Immediate Mode

If an MSP430 instruction is used with Immediate addressing mode, the constant is an 8- or 16-bit value and is stored in the word following the instruction.

## Length

Two or three words. One word less if a constant of the constant generator can be used for the immediate operand.

## Operation

The 16-bit immediate source operand is used together with the 16-bit destination operand.

## Comment

Valid only for the source operand

## Example

`ADD #3456h, &TONI;`

This instruction adds the 16-bit immediate operand 3456h to the data in the destination address TONI.

### Source

16-bit immediate value 3456h

### Destination

Word at address TONI
