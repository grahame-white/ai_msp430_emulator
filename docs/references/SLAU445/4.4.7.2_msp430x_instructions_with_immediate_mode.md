# 4.4.7.2 MSP430X Instructions With Immediate Mode

If an MSP430X instruction is used with Immediate addressing mode, the constant is a 20-bit value. The 4 MSBs of the
constant are stored in the extension word, and the 16 LSBs of the constant are stored in the word following the
instruction.

## Length

Three or four words. One word less if a constant of the constant generator can be used for the immediate operand.

## Operation

The 20-bit immediate source operand is used together with the 20-bit destination operand.

## Comment

Valid only for the source operand

## Example

`ADDX.A #23456h, &TONI;`

This instruction adds the 20-bit immediate operand 23456h to the data in the destination address TONI.

### Source

20-bit immediate value 23456h

### Destination

Two words beginning with address TONI
