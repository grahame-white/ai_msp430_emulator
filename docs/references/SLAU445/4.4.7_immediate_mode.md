# 4.4.7 Immediate Mode

The Immediate mode allows accessing constants as operands by including the constant in the memory location following the instruction. The PC is used with the Indirect Autoincrement mode. The PC points to the immediate value contained in the next word. After the fetching of the immediate operand, the PC is incremented by 2 for byte, word, or address-word instructions. The Immediate mode has two addressing possibilities:

- 8-bit or 16-bit constants with MSP430 instructions
- 20-bit constants with MSP430X instruction
