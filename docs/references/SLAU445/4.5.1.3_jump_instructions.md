# 4.5.1.3 Jump Instructions

Figure 4-24 shows the format for MSP430 and MSP430X jump instructions. The signed 10-bit word offset of the jump
instruction is multiplied by two, sign-extended to a 20-bit address, and added to the 20-bit PC. This allows jumps
in a range of â€“511 to +512 words relative to the PC in the full 20-bit address space. Jumps do not affect the
status bits. Table 4-6 lists and describes the eight jump instructions.

| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| JEQ, JZ  | Label          | Jump to label if zero bit is set     |
| JNE, JNZ | Label          | Jump to label if zero bit is reset   |
| JC       | Label          | Jump to label if carry bit is set    |
| JNC      | Label          | Jump to label if carry bit is reset  |
| JN       | Label          | Jump to label if negative bit is set |
| JGE      | Label          | Jump to label if (N XOR V) = 0       |
| JL       | Label          | Jump to label if (N XOR V) = 1       |
| JMP      | Label          | Jump to label unconditionally        |
