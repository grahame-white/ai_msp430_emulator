# 4.5.1 MSP430 Instructions

The MSP430 instructions can be used, regardless if the program resides in the lower 64KB or beyond it. The only
exceptions are the instructions CALL and RET, which are limited to the lower 64KB address range. CALLA and RETA
instructions have been added to the MSP430X CPU to handle subroutines in the entire address range with no code
size overhead.
