- 15:11 - Opcode
  - Extension word op-code. Op-codes 1800h to 1FFFh are extension words.
- 10:9 - Reserved
- 8 - ZC
  - Zero carry
    - 0 - The executed instruction uses the status of the carry bit C.
    - 1 - The executed instruction uses the carry bit as 0. The carry bit is defined by the result of the final operation after instruction execution.
- 7 - #
  - Repetition
    - 0 - The number of instruction repetitions is set by extension word bits 3:0.
    - 1 - The number of instruction repetitions is defined by the value of the four LSBs of Rn. See description for bits 3:0.
- 6 - A/L
  - Data length extension. Together with the B/W bits of the following MSP430 instruction, the AL bit defines the used data length of the instruction.
    | A/L | B/W | Comment             |
    | --- | --- | ------------------- |
    | 0   | 0   | Reserved            |
    | 0   | 1   | 20-bit address word |
    | 1   | 0   | 16-bit word         |
    | 1   | 1   | 8-bit byte          |
- 5:4 - Reserved
- 3:0 - Repetition count
  - \# = 0 These four bits set the repetition count n. These bits contain n – 1.
  - \# = 1 These four bits define the CPU register whose bits 3:0 set the number of repetitions. Rn.3:0 contain n – 1.
