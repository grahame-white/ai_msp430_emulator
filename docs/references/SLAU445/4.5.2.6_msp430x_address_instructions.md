# 4.5.2.6 MSP430X Address Instructions

MSP430X address instructions are instructions that support 20-bit operands but have restricted addressing modes.
The addressing modes are restricted to the Register mode and the Immediate mode, except for the MOVA instruction
as listed in Table 4-16. Restricting the addressing modes removes the need for the additional extension-word
op-code improving code density and execution time. Address instructions should be used any time an MSP430X
instruction is needed with the corresponding restricted addressing mode.

- â€“ = Status bit is not affected.
- 0 = Status bit is cleared.
- 1 = Status bit is set.
