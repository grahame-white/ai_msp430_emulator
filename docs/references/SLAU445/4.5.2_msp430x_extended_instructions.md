# 4.5.2 MSP430X Extended Instructions

The extended MSP430X instructions give the MSP430X CPU full access to its 20-bit address space. Most MSP430X
instructions require an additional word of op-code called the extension word. Some extended instructions do not
require an additional word and are noted in the instruction description. All addresses, indexes, and immediate
numbers have 20-bit values when preceded by the extension word.

There are two types of extension words:

- Register or register mode for Format I instructions and register mode for Format II instructions
- Extension word for all other address mode combinations
