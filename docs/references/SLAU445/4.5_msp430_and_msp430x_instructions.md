# 4.5 MSP430 and MSP430X Instructions

MSP430 instructions are the 27 implemented instructions of the MSP430 CPU. These instructions are used throughout the
1MB memory range unless their 16-bit capability is exceeded. The MSP430X instructions are used when the addressing
of the operands or the data length exceeds the 16-bit capability of the MSP430 instructions.

There are three possibilities when choosing between an MSP430 and MSP430X instruction:

- To use only the MSP430 instructions - The only exceptions are the CALLA and the RETA instruction. This can be
  done if a few, simple rules are met:
  - Place all constants, variables, arrays, tables, and data in the lower 64KB. This allows the use of MSP430
    instructions with 16-bit addressing for all data accesses. No pointers with 20-bit addresses are needed.
  - Place subroutine constants immediately after the subroutine code. This allows the use of the symbolic addressing
    mode with its 16-bit index to reach addresses within the range of PC + 32KB.
- To use only MSP430X instructions - The disadvantages of this method are the reduced speed due to the additional CPU
  cycles and the increased program space due to the necessary extension word for any double-operand instruction.
- Use the best fitting instruction where needed.

Section 4.5.1 lists and describes the MSP430 instructions, and Section 4.5.2 lists and describes the MSP430X instructions.
