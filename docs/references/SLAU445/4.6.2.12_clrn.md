## Syntax

- `CLRN`

## Operation

or

(NOT src AND dst → dst)

## Emulation

`BIC #4, SR`

## Description

The constant 04h is inverted (0FFFBh) and is logically ANDed with the destination
operand. The result is placed into the destination. The clear negative bit instruction is a word instruction.

## Status Bits

- N Reset to 0
- Z Not affected
- C Not affected
- V Not affected

## Example

The negative bit in the SR is cleared. This avoids special treatment with negative numbers of the subroutine called.

CLRN
CALL    SUBR
...
SUBR    JN    SUBRET  ; If input is negative: do nothing and return
...
SUBRET  RET
```
