# 4.6.2.13 CLRZ

- \* `CLRZ` - Clear zero bit

## Syntax

- `CLRZ`

## Operation

0 → Z

or

(NOT src AND dst → dst)

## Emulation

- `BIC #2,SR`

## Description

The constant 02h is inverted (0FFFDh) and logically ANDed with the destination
operand. The result is placed into the destination. The clear zero bit instruction is a word instruction.

## Status Bits

- N Not affected
- Z Reset to 0
- C Not affected
- V Not affected

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example

The zero bit in the SR is cleared.

```asm
CLRZ
```

Indirect, Auto-Increment mode:
Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in the word pointed to by register R5
(20-bit address) and increment the 16-bit address in R5 afterwards by 2. The next time the
software uses R5 as a pointer,
it can alter the program execution due to access to the next word address in the table pointed to by R5.

```asm
CALL  @R5+  ; Start address at @R5. R5 + 2
```

Indexed mode:
Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in the 20-bit address pointed to by register (R5 + X); for example,
a table with addresses starting at X. The address is within the lower 64KB. X is within ±32KB.

```asm
CALL  X(R5)  ; Start address at @(R5+X). z16(R5)
```
