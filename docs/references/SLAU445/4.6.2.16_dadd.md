# 4.6.2.16 DADD

- `DADD[.W]` - Add source word and carry decimally to destination word
- `DADD.B` - Add source byte and carry decimally to destination byte

## Syntax

- `DADD src, dst`
- `DADD.W src, dst`
- `DADD.B src, dst`

## Operation

src + dst + C â†’ dst (decimally)

## Description

The source operand and the destination operand are treated as two (.B) or four (.W) binary coded
decimals (BCD) with positive signs. The source operand and the carry bit C are added decimally to
the destination operand. The source operand is not affected. The previous content of the
destination is lost. The result is not defined for non-BCD numbers.

## Status Bits

- N Set if MSB of result is 1 (word > 7999h, byte > 79h), reset if MSB
is 0
- Z Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C Set if the BCD result is too large (word > 9999h, byte > 99h), reset otherwise
- V Undefined

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

Decimal 10 is added to the 16-bit BCD counter DECCNTR.

```asm
DADD  #10h,  &DECCNTR  ; Add 10 to 4-digit BCD counter
```

## Example 2

The eight-digit BCD number contained in 16-bit RAM addresses BCD and BCD+2 is added
decimally to an eight-digit BCD number contained in R4 and R5 (BCD+2 and R5 contain the MSDs).
The carry C is added,
and cleared.

```asm
CLRC                 ; Clear carry
DADD.W  &BCD,    R4  ; Add LSDs. R4.19:16 = 0
DADD.W  &BCD+2,  R5  ; Add MSDs with carry. R5.19:16 = 0
JC OVERFLOW          ; Result >9999,9999: go to error routine
...                  ; Result ok
```

## Example 3

The two-digit BCD number contained in word BCD (16-bit address) is added decimally to a
two-digit BCD number contained in R4. The carry C is added,
also. R4.19:8 = 0

```asm
CLRC              ; Clear carry
DADD.B  &BCD,  R4 ; Add BCD to R4 decimally.
                  ; R4: 0,00ddh
```
