# 4.6.2.17 DEC

- \* `DEC[.W]` - Decrement destination
- \* `DEC.B` - Decrement destination

## Syntax

- `DEC dst`
- `DEC.W dst`
- `DEC.B dst`

## Operation

dst – 1 → dst

## Emulation

- `SUB #1, dst`
- `SUB.B #1, dst`

## Description

The destination operand is decremented by one. The original contents are lost.

## Status Bits

- N Set if result is negative, reset if positive
- Z Set if dst contained 1, reset otherwise
- C Reset if dst contained 0, set otherwise
- V
  - Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs, otherwise reset.
  - Set if initial value of destination was 08000h, otherwise reset.
  - Set if initial value of destination was 080h, otherwise reset.

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

R10 is decremented by 1.

```asm
DEC  R10  ; Decrement R10
```

## Example 2

Move a block of 255 bytes from memory location starting with EDE to memory location starting with TONI.
Tables should not overlap: start of destination address TONI must not be within the range EDE to EDE+0FEh

```asm
     MOV    #EDE,  R6
     MOV    #255,  R10
L$1  MOV.B  @R6+,  TONI-EDE-1(R6)
     DEC    R10
     JNZ    L$1
```

Do not transfer tables using the routine above with the overlap shown in Figure 4-36.
