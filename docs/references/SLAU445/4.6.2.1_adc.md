# 4.6.2.1 ADC

- \* `ADC[.W]` - Add carry to destination
- \* `ADC.B` - Add carry to destination

## Syntax

- `ADC dst` or `ADC.W dst`
- `ADC.B dst`

## Operation

dst + C â†’ dst

## Emulation

- `ADDC #0, dst`
- `ADDC.B #0, dst`

## Description

The carry bit (C) is added to the destination operand. The previous contents of the destination are lost.

## Status Bits

- N Set if result is negative, reset if positive
- Z Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C
  - Set if dst was incremented from 0FFFFh to 0000, reset otherwise
  - Set if dst was incremented from 0FFh to 00, reset otherwise

- V Set if an arithmetic overflow occurs, otherwise reset

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

The 16-bit counter pointed to by R13 is added to a 32-bit counter pointed to by R12.

```asm
ADD  @R13,   0(R12) ; Add LSDs
ADC  2(R12)         ; Add carry to MSD
```

## Example 2

The 8-bit counter pointed to by R13 is added to a 16-bit counter pointed to by R12.

```asm
ADD.B  @R13,   0(R12) ; Add LSDs
ADC.B  1(R12)         ; Add carry to MSD
```
