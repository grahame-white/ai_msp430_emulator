# 4.6.2.2 ADD

`ADD[.W]` - Add source word to destination word
`ADD.B` - Add source byte to destination byte

# Syntax

- `ADD src, dst`
- `ADD.W src, dst`
- `ADD.B src, dst`

# Operation

src + dst â†’ dst

# Description

The source operand is added to the destination operand. The previous content of the destination is lost.

# Status Bits

- N Set if result is negative (MSB = 1), reset if positive (MSB = 0)
- Z Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C Set if there is a carry from the MSB of the result, reset otherwise
- V Set if the result of two positive operands is negative, or if the result of two negative<br>numbers is positive, reset otherwise

# Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

# Example 1

Ten is added to the 16-bit counter CNTR located in lower 64 K.

```asm
ADD.W #10, &CNTR ; Add 10 to 16-bit counter
```

# Example 2

A table word pointed to by R5 (20-bit address in R5) is added to R6. The jump to label TONI is performed on a carry.

```asm
ADD.W @R5, R6  ; Add table word to R6. R6.19:16 = 0
JC    TONI     ; Jump if carry
...            ; No carry
```

# Example 3

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is added to R6. The jump to label TONI is performed if no carry occurs. The table pointer is auto-incremented by 1. R6.19:8 = 0

```asm
ADD.B @R5+, R6 ; Add byte to R6. R5 + 1. R6: 000xxh
JNC   TONI     ; Jump if no carry
...            ; Carry occurred
```
