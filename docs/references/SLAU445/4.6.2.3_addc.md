# 4.6.2.3 ADDC

- `ADDC[.W]` - Add source word and carry to destination word
- `ADDC.B` - Add source byte and carry to destination byte

## Syntax

- `ADDC src, dst`
- `ADDC.W src, dst`
- `ADDC.B src, dst`

## Operation

src + dst + C â†’ dst

## Description

The source operand and the carry bit C are added to the destination operand. The previous content of the destination is lost.

## Status Bits

- N Set if result is negative (MSB = 1), reset if positive (MSB = 0)
- Z Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C Set if there is a carry from the MSB of the result, reset otherwise
- V Set if the result of two positive operands is negative, or if the result of two negative numbers is positive, reset otherwise

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example

Constant value 15 and the carry of the previous instruction are added to the 16-bit<br>counter CNTR located in lower 64 K.

```asm
ADDC.W #15, &CNTR; Add 15 + C to 16-bit CNTR
```

## Example

A table word pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) and the carry C are added to R6. The jump to label TONI is performed on a carry. R6.19:16 = 0

```asm
ADDC.W @R5, R6 ; Add table word + C to R6
JC TONI        ; Jump if carry
...            ; No carry
```

## Example

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) and the carry bit C are added to R6. The jump to label TONI is performed if no carry occurs. The table pointer is auto-incremented by 1. R6.19:8 = 0

```asm
ADDC.B @R5+, R6  ; Add table byte + C to R6. R5 + 1
JNC    TONI      ; Jump if no carry
...              ; Carry occurred
```
