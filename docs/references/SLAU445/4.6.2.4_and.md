# 4.6.2.4 AND

- `AND[.W]` - Logical AND of source word with destination word
- `AND.B` - Logical AND of source byte with destination byte

## Syntax

- `AND src, dst`
- `AND.W src, dst`
- `AND.B src, dst`

## Operation

src AND dst â†’ dst

## Description

The source operand and the destination operand are logically ANDed. The result is placed into the destination.
The source operand is not affected.

## Status Bits

- N Set if result is negative (MSB = 1), reset if positive (MSB = 0)
- Z Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C Set if the result is not zero, reset otherwise. C = (NOT Z)
- V Reset

## Mode

Bits OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

The bits set in R5 (16-bit data) are used as a mask (AA55h) for the word TOM located in the lower 64 K.
If the result is zero, a branch is taken to label TONI. R5.19:16 = 0

```asm
MOV  #AA55h,  R5   ; Load 16-bit mask to R5
AND  R5,      &TOM ; TOM .and. R5 -> TOM
JZ   TONI          ; Jump if result 0
...                ; Result > 0
```

or shorter:

```asm
AND  #AA55h,  &TOM ; TOM .and. AA55h -> TOM
JZ   TONI          ; Jump if result 0
```

## Example 2

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is logically ANDed with R6. R5 is incremented by 1 after the
fetching of the byte. R6.19:8 = 0

```asm
AND.B  @R5+,  R6 ; AND table byte with R6. R5 + 1
```
