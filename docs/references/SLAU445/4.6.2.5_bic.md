# 4.6.2.5 BIC

- `BIC[.W]` Clear bits set in source word in destination word
- `BIC.B` Clear bits set in source byte in destination byte

## Syntax

- `BIC src, dst`
- `BIC.W src, dst`
- `BIC.B src, dst`

## Operation

(NOT src) AND dst â†’ dst

## Description

The inverted source operand and the destination operand are logically ANDed. The result is placed into the destination. The source operand is not affected.

## Status Bits

- N Not affected
- Z Not affected
- C Not affected
- V Not affected

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

The bits 15:14 of R5 (16-bit data) are cleared. R5.19:16 = 0

```asm
BIC  #0C000h,  R5  ; Clear R5.19:14 bits
```

## Example 2

A table word pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to clear bits in R7. R7.19:16 = 0

```asm
BIC.W  @R5,  R7  ; Clear bits in R7 set in @R5
```

## Example 3

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to clear bits in Port1.

```asm
BIC.B  @R5,  &P1OUT  ; Clear I/O port P1 bits set in @R5
```
