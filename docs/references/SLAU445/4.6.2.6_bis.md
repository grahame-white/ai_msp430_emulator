# 4.6.2.6 BIS

- `BIS[.W]` Set bits set in source word in destination word
- `BIS.B` Set bits set in source byte in destination byte

## Syntax 

- `BIS src, dst`
- `BIS.W src, dst`
- `BIS.B src, dst`

## Operation

src OR dst â†’ dst

## Description

The source operand and the destination operand are logically ORed. The result is placed
into the destination. The source operand is not affected.

## Status Bits

- N: Not affected
- Z: Not affected
- C: Not affected
- V: Not affected

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

Bits 15 and 13 of R5 (16-bit data) are set to one. R5.19:16 = 0

```asm
BIS  #A000h,  R5  ; Set R5 bits
```

## Example 2

A table word pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to set bits in R7. R7.19:16 = 0

```asm
BIS.W  @R5,  R7  ; Set bits in R7
```

## Example 3

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to set bits in Port1. R5 is incremented by 1 afterwards.

```asm
BIS.B  @R5+,  &P1OUT  ; Set I/O port P1 bits. R5 + 1
```
