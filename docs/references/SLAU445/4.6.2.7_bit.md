# 4.6.2.7 BIT

- `BIT[.W]` Test bits set in source word in destination word
- `BIT.B` Test bits set in source byte in destination byte

## Syntax

- `BIT src, dst`
- `BIT.W src, dst`
- `BIT.B src, dst`

## Operation

src AND dst

## Description

The source operand and the destination operand are logically ANDed. The result affects only the status bits in SR.

Register mode: the register bits Rdst.19:16 (.W) resp. Rdst. 19:8 (.B) are not cleared!

## Status Bits

- N: Set if result is negative (MSB = 1), reset if positive (MSB = 0)
- Z: Set if result is zero, reset otherwise
- C: Set if the result is not zero, reset otherwise. C = (.not. Z)
- V: Reset

## Mode Bits

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Example 1

Test if one (or both) of bits 15 and 14 of R5 (16-bit data) is set. Jump to label TONI if this is the case. R5.19:16 are not affected.

```asm
BIT  #C000h,  R5  ; Test R5.15:14 bits
JNZ  TONI         ; At least one bit is set in R5
...               ; Both bits are reset
```

## Example 2

A table word pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to test bits in R7. Jump to label TONI if at least one bit is set. R7.19:16 are not affected.

```asm
BIT.W  @R5,  R7  ; Test bits in R7
JC     TONI      ; At least one bit is set
...              ; Both are reset
```

## Example 3

A table byte pointed to by R5 (20-bit address) is used to test bits in output Port1. Jump to label TONI if no bit is set. The next table byte is addressed.

```asm
BIT.B  @R5+,  &P1OUT  ; Test I/O port P1 bits. R5 + 1
JNC    TONI           ; No corresponding bit is set
...                   ; At least one bit is set
```
