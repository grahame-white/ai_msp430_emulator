# 4.6.2.8 BR, BRANCH

- \* `BR`, Branch to destination in lower 64K address space
- `BRANCH`

## Syntax

- `BR dst`

## Operation

dst â†’ PC

## Emulation

MOV dst,PC

## Description

An unconditional branch is taken to an address anywhere in the lower 64K address space. All source addressing modes can be used. The branch instruction is a word instruction.

## Status Bits

Status bits are not affected.

## Example

Examples for all addressing modes are given.

```asm
BR  #EXEC  ; Branch to label EXEC or direct branch (for example #0A4h)
           ; Core instruction MOV @PC+,PC

BR  EXEC   ; Branch to the address contained in EXEC
           ; Core instruction MOV X(PC),PC
           ; Indirect address

BR  &EXEC  ; Branch to the address contained in absolute
           ; address EXEC
           ; Core instruction MOV X(0),PC
           ; Indirect address

BR  R5     ; Branch to the address contained in R5
           ; Core instruction MOV R5,PC
           ; Indirect R5

BR  @R5    ; Branch to the address contained in the word
           ; pointed to by R5.
           ; Core instruction MOV @R5,PC
           ; Indirect, indirect R5

BR  @R5+   ; Branch to the address contained in the word pointed
           ; to by R5 and increment pointer in R5 afterwards.
           ; The next time-S/W flow uses R5 pointer-it can
           ; alter program execution due to access to
           ; next address in a table pointed to by R5
           ; Core instruction MOV @R5,PC
           ; Indirect, indirect R5 with autoincrement

BR  X(R5)  ; Branch to the address contained in the address
           ; pointed to by R5 + X (for example table with address
           ; starting at X). X can be an address or a label
           ; Core instruction MOV X(R5),PC
           ; Indirect, indirect R5 + X
```
