# 4.6.2.9 CALL

- `CALL` Call a subroutine in lower 64 K

## Syntax

- `CALL` dst

## Operation

1. dst → tmp 16-bit dst is evaluated and stored
1. SP – 2 → SP
1. PC → @SP updated PC with return address to TOS
1. tmp → PC saved 16-bit dst to PC

## Description

A subroutine call is made from an address in the lower 64 K to a subroutine address in the lower 64 K. All seven source addressing modes can be used. The call instruction is a word instruction. The return is made with the RET instruction.

## Status Bits

Status bits are not affected.

PC.19:16 cleared (address in lower 64 K)

## Mode Bits 

OSCOFF, CPUOFF, and GIE are not affected.

## Examples

Examples for all addressing modes are given.

Immediate Mode: Call a subroutine at label EXEC (lower 64 K) or call directly to address.

```asm
CALL  #EXEC   ; Start address EXEC
CALL  #0AA04h ; Start address 0AA04h
```

Symbolic Mode: Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in address EXEC. EXEC is located at the address (PC + X) where X is within PC ± 32 K.

```asm
CALL  EXEC  ; Start address at @EXEC. z16(PC)
```

Absolute Mode: Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in absolute address EXEC in the lower 64 K.

```asm
CALL  &EXEC  ; Start address at @EXEC
```

Register mode: Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in register R5.15:0.

```asm
CALL  R5  ; Start address at R5
```

Indirect Mode: Call a subroutine at the 16-bit address contained in the word pointed to by register R5 (20-bit address).

```asm
CALL  @R5  ; Start address at @R5
```
